# Introduction

A central characteristic of Julian of Norwich's writing has her desire to change or "reform" a dominant image of God. 

Thus, besides reminding us of the mystical tradition that sits alongside the tradition of the schools (or scholasticism), she also introduces to growing trend in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries to call for "reform."

This trend is visible to such an extent that the momentous reform movements of the 16-century might be best seen, NOT as a break with the late medieval tradition, but its culmination.

Julian offers us an example of a call to reform that will later by echoed by Martin Luther. Luther in his early life struggled with the image of God as an angry and wrathful deity. And accordingly, he was tortured by an image of himself as a worthless, guilty, sinner that pushed him to the point of a near nervous breakdown.

But Julian is not the only place we have seen calls for reform. 

We have seen monastic movements function as tools of reform. 

We have seen calls for clerical reform stretching back to Charlemagne, who issued edicts requiring schools for clergy which eventually becomes the seeds of cathedrals schools and the universities.

Dante offered us plenty of examples of calls for reform. If we had read *Inferno* we would have seen a domain filled with princes and church officials who were being eternally punished for their life on earth. 

But we will also saw extended speeches in *Purgatorio* decrying the state of the church, its entanglement with secular affairs, and its resulting corruption. 

Chaucer, then, can and should be for us another example of social criticism; an example of someone who, like Julian at the end of the 14th century, is intent to make it clear that society and the church are clearly in need of reform. 

While there are a million things we could focus on in Chaucer's *Canterbury Tales*, let's try to use the *Pardoner's Tale* to get a glimpse of his call for reform (as well as the particular comedic and entertaining style in which he issues this call.)

On the exam review sheet, I have suggested a few questions along these lines: 

* How does Chaucer continue the call for reform that we see elsewhere in the Middle Ages?
* What is estate satire? How do the *Pardoner’s Tale* exemplify this?

# Who is Chaucer?

First, it will be helpful if we know a little bit about who Chaucer is. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
What if anything do you know about Chaucer? 

{:.rquestion}
When did he live? What kind of career did he have?

{:.rquestion}
Can you share any useful links that can get us up to speed about his biography?
<!--

  * His work at a traveling civil servant certainly explains what we will see as critical characteristic of the Canturbury Tales. Namely, he had the opportunity to see an interact with society at all levels; a unique experience as most people would spend of their time with members of their own class and rarely interact with someone outside of it. 
  * intro p. xii, "Chaucer's career gave him the support and patronage he needed to write poetry, but it also provided a tour of human variety, since Chaucer himself lived a life of extraordinary social mobility for the Middle Ages"
  * "...Chaucer was, essentially, a civil servant...
  * p. xiii, "A controller of Customs from 1374 he was responsible for keeping accurate records of the various payments of the export duty on wool..."
  * "...As Clerk of the King's Works from 1389 he would have sent letters in a variety of directions to maintain the king's properties for which he was responsible" -->

# The Canterbury Tales, *In General*

<div class="discussion">

{:.rquestion}
How many people have read the *Canterbury Tales* before? Does anyone know the basic trope organizing these different tales?

{:.rquestion}
If you've read parts of it before, do you have any favorite tales? Tell us about them and why?

</div>

*Canterbury Tales* is an example of "frame tale". That is, there is a larger story that includes the telling of several smaller stories. 

Chaucer probably learned this structure from Boccaccio (1313-1375), who wrote the [*Decameron*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decameron), in which several characters quarantine outside the city in the midst of the plague and begin telling stories to pass the time.

Due to time constraints I didn't have you read the very important, but quite long prologue. 

But in the prologue, we learn that a bunch of travelers, 29 to be exact find themselves at the Tabard Inn.

{:.rquestion}
Where do they plan to travel?

{:.rquestion}
Why do you think they are traveling to this location?

To pass the time, the Host of the Tabard Inn suggests a game, namely: everyone should tell two stories, two on the way there and two on the way back. Whoever tells the best story will be treated to a dinner by everyone else. 

And thus the story begins. The design of the host is never fully realized. Barely everyone has time to tell one story, and it suggested that this is both by Chaucer's design and also that he may have left the work unfinished.

For us, without reading the prologue, it will be enough to look at the list of 29 pilgrims.

* the knight
* the miller
* the reeve,
* the cook
* the man of laws
* the wife of bath,
* the friar

**The Three Estates**

It is perhaps helpful to note that Chaucer’s *Canterbury Tales* is often identified as an example of a larger medieval literary genre known as **Estate Satire**. 

Estate satire starts from the idea that there are three dominant estates or classes in medieval society. 

* The Clergy ("those that pray")
* The Nobility ("those that fight")
* The Commoner ("those that worK")

Here's how Chaucer's contemporary John Gower described the estates:

> "We recognize that there are three estates. In his own way, everyone in the world lives under them and serves them. No estate is accused as being at fault, but when estates transgress against virtue, their fault declares against them. I shall write what others say, for I do not wish anyone to assume that this is a work of my own originality. He who arraigns vices is praising virtues, in order that the good man may thereby stand out all the more in his goodness. Just as white is more plainly evident when placed next to black, so good things are made more readily apparent when they are placed by evil ones. Therefore, if a writer should touch upon evil men, this should not vex the good. Let the heart's balance weigh its burden patiently: truth does not refuse to be depicted, for it is the true account that ought to be written up, not the false talk of flattering guile. If I have any glimmer of sense, I pray that God increase it to the highest fruitfulness. If a piece of writing contains something good, may the fountain goodness distil it and may God grant that a man write good things. May God make fruitful in his servant those writings which will be of use. Let man provide the proper seeds and God the grain. I confess that I am overcome by the magnitude of the undertaking, but hope offers promise to me of bringing it to a good conclusion. Because hope offers promise, love embraces the task, and faith lends aid and counsel to them both. It suggests, incites, persuades, and vouches for the fruit of my labor. It cries out, "Begin, the task will be done." John Gower Vox Clamantis, Book 3, Prologue (See: http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/middleages/topic_1/satire.htm)

As Gower makes clear, society has expectations for each class and part of being a good member of society was living up to the expectations of the class in which one is a member.

The rise of estate satire in the late 14th century is sometimes taken as sign of a frustration with growing social hypocrisy and growing breakdown in social mores.

Consider Gower's description of the class of clerics.

> "On Prelates: There are the cleric, the knight, and the peasant, three carrying on three different things. But I intend to write about the prelates first. The schism evident today shows that there are two popes, one a schismatic and the other the proper one. France favors the schismatic and declares that he ought to be revered, but England everywhere preserves the right faith. I accordingly bequeath the good things said by my writings about this matter to good readers wherever they may be, and I bequeath the bad things to the bad."

> "As I seek for followers of Christ among the prelates I find that none of the rule remains which used to be in force. Christ was poor, but they are overloaded with gold. He used to make peace, but they now wage war. Christ was generous, but they are as close as a money-box. Work occupied Him, but plentiful rest pampers them. Christ was gentle, but they are violent. He suffered humbly, but they desire to be superior. Christ was compassionate, but they seek after vengeance. He endured torments, but fear of torments puts them to flight. Christ was a virgin; they are rarely chaste. He is a good shepherd, but they devour the flock of sheep." (John Gower Vox Clamantis, Book 3, Prologue (See: http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/middleages/topic_1/satire.htm)

We have to remember that the 14th century was the century of the plague, The Hundred Year’s war (1337-1453), and as the excerpt from Gower notes, the time of the Western Schism when there were two popes. (If there were a sign of disorder for the medieval pilgrim, this was it).

So, like Dante, Chaucer is engaged in a kind of call for reform. But unlike Dante's very pious and serious call, Chaucer’s call for reform is biting and satirical.

Let’s look and see to what degree we can see this in our two stories for today. 

# Pardoner’s Tale

Here's a little background on what a Pardoner is:

> “In the Middle Ages, a pardoner was an official of the church whose duty was to collect charitable offerings for religious purposes on behalf of some ecclesiastical institution. The Christian Church was a keeper of the treasury of grace which had been gathered by Christ and the saints. Some of that grace was distributed by authorized people who would collect in return money and possessions which were needed for building and equipping churches and hospitals. This system, in theory a means by which sinners could gain access to the Church’s ‘treasury of grace’, was in practice open to gross corruption." (Nazan Çakçak, "The Self-Revelatory Tendencies of The Pardoner in the Canterbury Tales", p. 139).

> "In this instance he is supposed to be 'of Rouncivale', that necessitates that he act on behalf of the hospital of the Blessed Mary of Rouncivalle at Charing Cross in London." (Nazan Çakçak, "The Self-Revelatory Tendencies of The Pardoner in the Canterbury Tales", p. 140)

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Let's look together at the Pardoner's prologue.

{:.rquestion}
What does Chaucer's Pardoner reveal about himself in his prologue?

{:.rquestion}
In what way does this prologue imply a kind of critique and can thereby be seen as a call for reform?

</div>


<div type="discussion" markdown="1">

Now let's look at the story

{:.rquestion}
What happens here? What's the main plot?

{:rquestion}
What feeling do you get as the Pardoner moves from his morality tale to final sermon asking people to buy indulgences?

{:rquestion}
Why does the Pardoner do this after telling everyone is his prologue that the relics aren’t real and that he’s only after money

{:.rquestion}
What do think is the meta-message of this tale? Or perhaps of the Prologue and the Tale taken together?

</div>

<!-- One historical note.

The story itself mirrors a common "morality tale" that you would find in a sermon a regular basis. 

> "There is a story about a certain performer who had a small horse that he was accustomed to ride and who frequently performed with this horse at court. Among the games that he taught the horse to play, one was that whenever he said “bend your knees,” the horse would obey and genuflect. But when he said, “get up,” the horse would rise up. Therefore it happened that the minstrel performer was approaching the feast of some noble and his horse was collected in the stable with the horses of the other guests. But when the men had eaten, the minstrel, as was his custom, began performing a game before the court. Meanwhile, a certain squire hurried to the stable and, seeing the pleasant and handsome horse of the minstrel, left his own sickly horse and mounted the pleasant and healthy horse of the minstrel and departed. Immediately after the minstrel became aware of this, he left everyone else and followed swiftly after the squire. The squire, seeing that the minstrel had almost reach him and apprehended him, attempted to cross a river that no one on foot was able to cross. Then, the minstrel, seeing that the squire was about to hurt his horse, cried out loudly to his horse in his usual way, while the horse was standing in the middle of a river, “bend your knees.” Immediately, the horse heard the voice of his master and bent his knees and threw the squire into the water. And when the minstrel had cried out, “get up,” the horse rose up and returned to his master. The minstrel who plays tricks and mocks and deceives men is the world. The horse, with which he skillfully and expertly plays, is temporal honor" (Witt and Slotemarker, *Robert Holcot*, p. 167) -->


One suggestion might be that his story is so much part of his routine or his “stump” speech that he’s not really thinking about it, he’s just following his normal routine.

Finally, if Chaucer (the author) is a kind of moralist calling for a kind of reform, can we compare the rhetorical strategies of Chaucer and Dante.


# Threads to the Modern World

Since the step in the Human Drama sequence is the Modern World, its worth highlighting some of the key late medieval events and movements noted by Rosenwein that will lead us into modernity.

## The Ottoman Empire (SHMA p. 300-304)

* The Ottoman Empire starts in 1281 as small principality in Anatolia. 
* It expands by taking advantage of fragmentation and disagreement among Byzantine principalities and weakening Mongol power
* Othman (d. 1324/1326) (from which the Dynasty gets its name) was the most famous and impressive Ottoman leader.
* The Ottoman's conquer Constantinople in 1453 
  * They employed modern weaponry (cannons) to help conquer Constantinople (SHMA, p. 301).
  * The defeat was a big psychological blow to the church and western Europe 
    * SHMA, p. 302: "The Fall of Byzantium made clear to many Italians the irrefutable end of the Roman Empir, an event of epochal proportions"
* The Ottoman empire is another example of the influence and legacy of the Middle Ages in modernity. The Empire existed and wielded influence into the 20th century, eventually forming a part of the "Central Powers" coalition in World War 1 (germany, austria-hungary, ottoman empire, bulgaria). It dissolved in the aftermath of the war and was eventually replaced by the Republic of Turkey, which continues to be a world power today.

## Renaissance

The Ottoman conquest of Constantinople also created a class of Greek immigrants. Where do they go? (see SHMA, p. 302)

{:.rquestion}
What was going on in Italy during the 14th and 15th centuries?

{:.rquestion}
How might the influx of Greek immigrants assist this development?

{:.rquestion}
What are some of the defining characteristics of the Renaissance according to Rosenwein? (See SHMA, pp. 319-323.)


Let's connect this with a couple other forward looking trends

## Printing Press

{:.rquestion}
In what way do we see the growing lay literacy connect to emerging technical innovations. 

Consider the invention of printing press circa 1450. (See SHMA p. 329.)

The Renaissance certainly helped produce a growing demand for books. But conversely, the sudden speed and reduced cost with which books could be produced also helped promote a new level of lay literacy.

## Reform

{:.rquestion}
In what way do we see the growing lay literacy connect to emerging religious movements? 

The movements of Wycliff and Huss called for the Bible to be translated into the vernacular and to allow the Bible to be read by the lay population (See SHMA, p. 318)

{:.rquestion}
Why is this a political threat? 

Access to information poses a threat to one way power is consolidated. If one can see it (read it) for themselves, they no longer remain dependent on those that do have access. 

<!-- ## National Churches

If the relationship of the Church estate to the lay population is changing in the light of growing literacy and renewed call for reforms, how is the Church's relation to the State changing (or beginning to change and pointing even more significant changes in the modern world)?

In the late middle ages, we start to see the growth of national churches, for example: followers of Jan Hus, allied with nobility for protection and created their own national church independent of papal power

But we also see milder versions of this kind of national control in catholic/papal strongholds.

For example, in France: 

(Let's connect with two things we've talked about.)

1) Review: First, how does this take back of power connect to most significant consequences of the Hundred's year war?

Question: Why was the Hundred's year particular significant for France? It resulted in the growth of centralized French power. 

And now we see that power beginning to flex its muscle. 

"Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges" in 1438 (see p. 324)

2) Does this remind us of an older controversy? 

What does this sanction allow Charles VII to do? How is that related to the aspirations of Henry IV and Gregory VII in the 11th century?

We see a similar claim for control in Spain, which notably included a royal version of church inquisition in 1478, (known as the spanish inquisition) which was part of the final steps of "reconquering" Iberia, which had included partial muslim control since the 8th century (under the Ummayads) -->

## Colonialism

Finally, it worth noting how the slow and inchoate formation of independent nations states (as we've seen in England and France, after the Hundred Year's War, along with Spain and Portugal) starts to lead to a national competition that expresses itself outward in the form of expansion. This was a precursor to the rise of colonialization that marks the early modern period.

The cultivation of cane sugar, the ravenous demand for the product in Europe, and the desire to dominate the market is also a notable catalyst for the expansionist aims of european powers (see SHMA, p. 332)

Rosenwein notes the fierce national competition on page 340 as a cause of Columbus' Spanish sponsored voyage to America:

> "Portugals's successes and pretensions roused the hostility and rivalry of Castile. Fredinand and Isabella's determination to conquer the canary Islands was in part their "answer" to Portugal's Cape Verde. When, in 1492, they half-heartedly sponsored the Genoese Christopher Columbus on a westward voyage across the Atlantic, they were trying to best Portugal at its own game." (SHMA, p. 333)

# Conclusion

I’d like to close our semester simply by acknowledging what a lovely semester it has been: it is a real privilege to be able to read these texts with you; to discuss, debate, and reflect together on ideas and history. 

I know its hard to appreciate what a luxury it is to be able to do this at the end of the semester, but I hope you will be able to reflect back positively on our time together; and I hope that this will inspire you to make free and open intellectual inquiry a part of your life-long habit. 

As a final parting word about the Middle Ages, I hope that you’ll come away from this class with the recognition that history is important to the present. 

The truth is that NONE of us think in vacuum. All of us are and speaking and thinking through an inherited history that shapes us. 

In order therefore, to truly engage in a life of self-examination, to be able to hold up your own ideas, beliefs, and prejudices to the light of critical examination, you must have a sense of the cultural past we all inherit. I think we’ve realized together why a lot of people don’t do that --- because it’s hard work and it take discipline and commitment.

However, I hope that we’ve be able to see this importance in different ways throughout our semester together: whether through analyzing competing conceptions of happiness, the generation of new ideas about what human life is for, the political uses of the other, how to response to the problem of evil, or even the rise of the university (of which we are all clear inheritors). 

I hope this sense of dependence will stick with you and you’ll be encouraged to continue to pursue a deeper and deeper historical understanding of the world you inhabit.

Thank you for a great semester. Please know that just because you’re not in my class next semester doesn’t mean my door is not open to you. Please make sure to say "hi" as we meet around campus. And if I can do anything for you in the future please don’t hesitate to stop by my office and ask.
