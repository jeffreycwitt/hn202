Some Key Dates. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">
{:.rquestion}

What’s important about these dates? How do they help us tell our story?

* 711
* 717
* 732
* 751
* 754
* 800
  
</div>

800 is a date we didn't get a chance to say too much about.

If you recall, Rosenwein suggested that Carolingian success had something to do with the way Charlemagne effectively used the symbols of Rome to his advantage, while at the same time deviating from Roman practices and innovating when it was to his advantage. 

The events of Christmas Day 800 capture this tension to some extent (see SHMA, p. 100).

* Charlemagne takes on the title of "Augustus" and Emperor (which is very Roman)
* But he allows himself to be crowned by the Pope (which is rather un-roman). 

We can also see slightly different interpretations of this event.

{:.question}
How might the Pope interpret this event? 

{:.answer}
If the pope can crown the emperor, perhaps the pope can "uncrown" an emperor? At the very least, the authority of the emperor seems to flow through the Pope.

Charlemagne, however, later calls himself "serene Augustus, crowned by God". The suggestion is that Charlemagne's power comes directly from God. The Pope's involvement is a witness to this direct authority, not a necessary mediator.

Here we see the seeds for several controversies that will follow in the Middle Ages. 

Generally, the debate is about the relation between secular and spiritual power and where the secular receives it power. 

Within the debate there is common assumption that all political authority comes from God, but a debate about how that power is transferred. The Medieval "Hierocratic" view believes that God transfers power to the pope who then transfers part of that power to secular princes. 

The contrasting view is that God appoints one ruler to care for the spiritual needs of people and another ruler with jurisdiction over secular concerns. Neither has jurisdiction over the other and both receive their authority directly from God. In theory, these powers should not conflict since their jurisdictions are over separate spheres. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.dquestion}
But can we think of examples of how these theoretically separate jurisdictions might conflict in practice? 

<div class="answer" markdown="1">
For example: 

* Discipline of clergy who injury non-clergy
* Collection revenues from a church or monastery or the vassals of the land connected to a church or monastery. Is the church or monastery itself a vassal? of whom? Should the church collect revenue at all? etc. 

</div>
  
</div>

In any case, this will be a perpetual conflict that we will see below, as well as in the later Middle Ages. For now, let's turn to the decline of the Carolingian Empire and the conditions leading up to the First Crusade. -->
 
# Decline of the Carolingian Empire

In 814 Charlemagne dies and is succeeded by his son, Louis the Pious (r. 814-840).

Louis the Pious is often considered well meaning, but his rule suffered from at least two big problems.

1. Viking Invasions (especially during the first part of the 9th century)
   1. Several coastal areas (western Francia) were lost between 814-840 (see SHMA 134-140).
2. His sons fought amongst themselves and against their father. (This created civil wars that were beginning to break up the empire into areas that look more similar to what we see on a modern map.)

The conflicts between the sons of Louis the Pious are particularly well illustrated in the events following Louis’ death in 840.

* Lothar, the eldest son, claims the title of emperor. As eldest son, this may seem somewhat understandable, but we should note that it was a Frankish custom (Merovingian and Carolingian) to divide the kingdom up among a King’s surviving sons (as the 806 arrangement by Charlemagne made clear).
* But the even greater offense was that Lothar supported his nephew Pippin (grandson of Louis the Pious) to rule Aquitaine over Charles the Bald. Charles the Bald was Lothar's brother and direct son of Louis the Pious, and Charles had been expressly granted the area by Louis the Pious himself. 
* No one was very happy with Lothar. Lothar’s brothers, Louis the German and Charles the Bald, joined forces and went to war against Lothar. 
* The end result was a victory by the united brothers against Lothar. This victory persuaded Lothar to give up his claim to be sole emperor and to negotiate a division of Charlemagne’s original empire. 

This division is known as the Treaty of Verdun which was signed in 843.

![Treat of Verdun Map]({{site.assets_url}}Treaty_of_Verdun_843.svg)

There are few things to note about the treaty.

* One part (the western part, seen in orange) would go to Charles the Bald. 
  * It would become Western Francia and starts to resemble modern day France.
* The eastern part (seen in green) would go to Louis the German.
  * This would be come Eastern Francia and begins to resemble something like modern day West Germany.
* Lothar (the eldest son) would rule the middle part (seen in purple) from Frisia (modern day Netherlands) to Rome. 
  * This is the most prestigious and richest part of the empire. It includes Aachen and Rome. 
  * The problem is that this geographic area is very hard to defend.
  * The Alps effectively cut off the North from the South.
  * It is, therefore, not a complete surprise today that we see this area divided into many different nations.
  * It has been the center many conflicts throughout history.
    * For example: a great deal World War I on the Western Front took place in the northern part of Lothar’s kingdom.
* In Eastern Francia, the Carolingian dynasty dies out in 911 (reclaimed by Otto in 962).
* In Western Francia, the Carolingian dynasty remains until 987 (replaced by the Capetian dynasty).

# The 10th Century: a new world order

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.dquestion}
So, what was social and political life like in the 10th and 11th centuries, after the Treaty of Verdun, and after the Carolingian lines had ended in both East Francia and West Francia? (Consider SHMA pp. 141-155 and the introduction of our "First Crusade Reader"; can you point us to any relevant passages?)

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

Wikipedia captures the common way historians often describe this period.

> (Wikipedia): "After the collapse of the Carolingian empire in the ninth century, France had degenerated into many small counties and lordships, in which local lords and knights frequently fought each other for control. At the same time there were often attacks from the Vikings, who settled in northern France as Normans but continued to raid territory further inland."

</div>
</div>

Here is a map of Europe in the 11th century showing the kind of political fragmentation that is occurring: 

![Holy Roman Empire around 11th century]({{site.assets_url}}Holy_Roman_Empire_11th_century.svg)

This fragmentation had serious and long-term consequences.

Rosenwein write: 

> "[The] origins [of feudalism] are to be found in the break-up of the Carolingian order -- the tenth and eleventh century" (SHMA, 5th edition, p. 136)

Why? Even though a central government could not be sustained, there was still a constant need for protection and defense. 

Land-owners (lords) needed protectors, and thus they gave part of their land (as a *fief*) to others in exchange for an oath of loyalty (echoing the oaths that Charlemagne had required of the nobles in his empire). These smaller “lords” did the same in turn, and this created a complicated network of relations based on familiarity and trust.

As Rosenwein states: 

> "Tenth-century rulers were more dependent on ties of dependency: they needed their "men" (homines), their vassals (vassalli). Whatever the term, all were armed retainers who fought for a lord." (SHMA, p. 141)

And again: 

> "Sometimes these subordinates held land from their lord as a reward for their military service or as an inheritance for which services were due. The term for such an estate, fief (foedum), gave historians the word "feudalism" to describe the social and economic system created by the relationships among lords, vassals, and fiefs." (SHMA, pp. 141)

In short, what we call Germany and France in 10th century were more like a series of principalities, over whom kings (and even the so-called emperor) had little direct sovereign power.

This political fragmentation and resulting political landscape gave rise to a couple of related phenomena in the 10th century (both of which are mentioned in our "The First Crusade" (TFC) reader.)

1. The need for church reform (TFC, pp. 4-6 )
2. The rise of an unruly military class (TFC, pp. 7-13)

Let's discuss each of these phenomena in turn, with an eye toward the rise of the First Crusade.

# From the Cluniac Reforms to Papal Power and Independence

The disruption of the 10th century and the rise of local principalities included the rise of [proprietary churches and monasteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_church). (Basically, these are churches/monasteries that take part in the feudal system). 

The reason we need to linger here is that we need to have some sense of how we could go from the weak popes of the 9th century (in constant need of protection from Charlemagne and others) to popes who are able to summon armies and inspire continental forces to travel across the world on a military expedition. The struggle to reform proprietary churches is part of this story.

The need for reform is summarized in the quotation below:

>  "The great abbeys in West Francia were made party to civil strife in the struggle over the succession between the Carolingians and the ancestors of the later Capetians. The proprietary church system and the lay abbacies under the heirs of Louis the Pious were responsible for this state of affairs. The Proprietor and/or abbot would change with every turn in military fortune. Often abbeys were turned into fortresses and made to serve as domicile for the lord of the monastery with his troops and his wife, children, dogs, and horses" (Blumenthal, "Investiture Controversy”, p. 4).

{:.rquestion}
Can you paraphrase this excerpt? What’s going on here? What is the effect of simultaneously having successions disputes and proprietary churches?

A critical step in this development involves a monastic reform movement we already know about.

Cluniac Monasticism began as an attempt to free the monastery from this kind of dependence on secular power and local leaders. 

The first Cluny house was established in 909, but its foundation was unique.

> "The foundation charter of William the Pious of 909 was rather unusual, for it immediately protected the monastery and its property from intervention and alienation by any secular power..." (Blumenthal, *Investiture Controversy*, p. 11)

Instead of relying on protection from a local prince or even a local bishop (who would have often been an appointee of the local prince), Cluny paid an annual sum directly to Rome for recognition and defense.

The Charter also insisted that Cluny would retain the right to "abbatial election". They could choose their own abbot rather than having to accept an abbot appointed by the local ruler (or bishop, who, again, was appointed by a local ruler). 

As we know, Cluny was, by the 11th century, a runaway success, and -- in the minds of many of its monks and aristocrats sympathetic to church reform -- this success had a lot to do with its independence from local state control.

It is no accident then that most of the so-called "reforming" popes of the 11th century were former leading monks within Cluny and other similar monastic movements. Robinson writes: 

> "The eleventh-century reform was essentially an attempt by men trained in the monastic discipline to remodel the Church and society according to monastic ideals." (Robinson, *Authority and Resistance*, p. 2)

And...

> "The characteristic accusation which the eleventh-century reformers levelled against their opponents in the Church was that the latter lived *more laicorum*, 'in the manner of laymen'." (Robinson, *Authority and Resistance*, p. 3)

Monks trained at Cluny had a different attitude about the relationship between church and state. Of foremost importance was the idea that the church should be under its own jurisdiction, removed from the jurisdiction of secular rulers. 

The most well-known reforming pope was Gregory VII, a former monk. Gregory VII is responsible for what has come to be known as the "Investiture Controversy": the key controversy with which the introduction to our reader (TFC) begins.

Robinson explains:

> “In the first two years of his pontificate Gregory VII sought to limit royal control of the Church in Germany and Italy by forcing Henry IV to abandon the custom of investing bishops with the symbols of their office [aka "investiture"]. The pope at first tried to procure the deposition of German bishops who were notoriously royal appointees, invested without reference to the rights of canonical electors, and eventually issued a decree prohibiting lay investiture.” (Robinson, *Authority and Resistance*, p. 4).

This is strong evidence for how much has changed since the days of Pippin and Stephen II or Charlemagne and Pope Leo III. 

Henry IV (Ruler of East Francia and claimant to the title of Holy Roman Emperor) obviously did not like this and resisted.

I think it’s important to keep in mind that this is not just a battle of ideas, but it had real material and economic consequences. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.dquestion}
If we think of the feudal system and think of churches and monasteries as intermingled in this system, how does the papal attempt to appoint and therefore oversee bishoprics and monasteries materially and economically affect a king like Henry IV?

{:.answer}
If homage is paid upward to the pope and not to the king, Henry loses an incredible amount of property. By some estimates this could be as much as half of the land under his jurisdiction.

</div>

Consider the following map (during the later Hohenstaufen Dynasty in the middle of the 12th century) which illustrates the number of fiefdoms governed directly by a church bishop (seen in purple). (Incidentally, this map shows how little direct control the so-called "Holy Roman Emperor" actually had. Only the areas in "bright yellow" are considered under **direct** control by the Hohenstaufen family. All the other lands are included in the empire through a complicated and fragile set of agreements).

![Holy Roman Empire under Hohenstaufen Dynasty in the middle of the 12th century](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Mitteleuropa_zur_Zeit_der_Staufer.svg/1280px-Mitteleuropa_zur_Zeit_der_Staufer.svg.png) (Map By Alphathon, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=48588928 re-rendered from Professor G. Droysens Allgemeiner Historischer Handatlas, which was published in 1886 by Richard Andree)

In the course of this controversy, Gregory excommunicated Henry IV several times, and Henry IV appointed his own anti-pope. 

Consider Robinson's description: 

> "The novel feature of the Investiture Contest was that the pope claimed to oppose the authority of the Salian ruler in the name of the whole Catholic Church. Bishops who continued to adhere to Henry IV were excommunicated by the pope and declared to have been deposed in favour of ‘Catholic’ – that is, pro papal – candidates. An anti-papal polemicist of the early 1090s was to deride the claims of 'the faction of Gregory [VII]' to be the sole representatives of the Catholic Church: the truth of the matter was that the papal party had sacrificed the unity of the Church to its own narrow factional interests. Gregory VII’s own interpretation of his actions was that he sought to restore the imperial to its original liberty and purity, by freeing it from the ‘the will of impious men’ and ‘the wicked custom of this world’ – that is, from royal dominance." (Robinson, *Authority and Resistance*, p. 5)

As Robinson notes, there is a unique irony in Gregory VII’s ambition. 

On the one hand, he declares his intention to draw the clergy away from the world, to stand separate and apart, to be *monk-like*.

But in doing so the Papacy and the church at large, through their proposed separation, are forced to take on all the earthly tasks that would previously have been done by the king or lord (most notably, maintain and protect property and distribute resources, but also ensure domestic peace by imposing discipline and punishing injustice). 

Through the task of appointing bishops (many of whom functioned as political governors in their local diocese) and demanding jurisdiction over clerical disputes, the church became ever more entangled in the administration of day-to-day or secular affairs. 

# Military Reform: the creation of the Christian Warrior

At the same time that these church reforms were taking place, a necessary kind of military reform was also taking place.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
From our introduction, did you get a sense of some of the problems that were being raised? How would you describe the problem in your own words?

</div>

Here are two telling quotations from our introduction:

> "The Military aristocracy of the eleventh century had achieved its precarious eminence in Western Society by virtue of its prowess in war and its loyalty – and frequent strategic disloyalty – to the weakened kings and ambitious territorial lords who carved their principalities out of the old divisions of the Carolingian Empire and augmented them by purchase, marriage, cunning, and force." (TFC, Peters, p. 7)

> "Kin groups claiming aristocratic status asserted their right to rule through their prowess in war and claimed public authority in their own territories, often with little concern for kings. They were capable of being mobilized for larger enterprises only by claims on their friendship and willing cooperation. How and when the world of Carolingian kings gave way to that of territorial principalities and tough and stubborn castellans is still a matter of scholarly debate, but it is clear that the reality and imagery of a motley warrior group remaking itself into a knightly elite was a process well underway in the eleventh century, regardless of the differences among them in wealth and social rank." (TFC, Peters, pp. 7-8)

This emergence of a military aristocracy without much to do was a recipe for political chaos. In such a situation, you can’t get much done. Every time you start a project, someone rides through on a horse and destroys it.

The question is how can these reforming popes (who now control considerable lands attached to church and monasteries newly freed from imperial control) deal with this excessive and unruly military class, particularly in way that is favorable to the growing independence of the papacy.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
How does the reading suggest they did this? (Look especially at the discussion in the introduction on page 8.)

{:.dquestion}
What is the proposed traditional Christian response to violence and military activity? 

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

Killing is a sin, fighting is a sin that requires penance.

> "The Christian response to sin was penance..." (TFC, p. 8)
</div>

{:.question}
Is there anything particularly Augustinian about this attitude? 

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

War, fighting, and killing may be necessary evils at times, but they are always “evils”. They are part of the muck and mire that pollutes our lives on earth. They may need to be endured. But they are not to be celebrated. They should always be followed by penance. 

This seems similar to the way Augustine described the penitent judge in *City of God*, 19, c. 6:

> "But though we acquit the judge of malice, we must non the less condemn human life as miserable…Surely it were proof of more profound considerateness and finer feeling were he to recognize the misery of these necessities, and shrink from his own implication in that miser; and had he any piety about him, he would cry to God, 'from my necessities deliver Thou me.'" (Augustine, *City of God*, Book 19, c. 6, p. 682-683)

Consider even more directly what Augustine said about "Just War"

> "As if he would not all the rather lament the necessity of just wars, if he remembers that he is a man; for if they were not just he would not wage them, and would therefore be delivered from all wars. For it is the wrongdoing of the opposing party which compels the wise man to wage just wars; and this wrong-doing, even though it gave rise to no war, would still be matter of grief to man because it is man's wrong-doing. Let every one, then, who thinks with pain on all these great evils, so horrible, so ruthless, acknowledge that this is misery. And if any one either endures or thinks of them without mental pain, this is a more miserable plight still, for he thinks himself happy because he has lost human feeling." (Augustine, *City of God*, Book 19, c. 7)

In short: war may be necessary, but it is a misery and something to be avoided and atoned for.

</div>

{:.dquestion}
How well do you think this is working for the popes, who are now directly in control of "Christian Lands"?

<div class="answer">

It doesn’t seem like it is working that well.

The popes and kings still needed people to fight. They needed professional/career fighters. Traditional penance required the suspension of warrior activity.

> “these acts, however, regularly required a suspension of the warriors’ most distinctive function” (TFC, p. 8)

</div>

{:.dquestion}
So, what is the new strategy that emerges?

{:.answer}
The Popes attempt to develop a doctrine by which "fighting itself might be considered a penitential and spiritually meritorious act." (TFC, p. 8)

</div>

Concretely, there are couple of different ways the church tried to provide opportunities for this "spiritualized" warrior activity.

## The Peace and Truce of God 

Prior to the Crusades, there was attempt by the church to suppress and limit this violence through a loosely defined set of rules called the "Peace and Truce of God" (see also SHMA, 145).

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

So, let’s look at the “Truce of God” proclaimed in Cologne (see TFC, p. 38).

{:.rquestion}
What is the substance of this proclamation?

{:.dquestion}
What distinction is made between the "Peace of God" and the "Truce of God"?

{:.answer}
The *Peace* was a prohibition against attacking women and children. The *Truce* was a prohibition against attacking other knights in certain places or certain times.

</div>

In a primitive way, the church is creating rules and codes of conduct for distinguishing a Christian warrior from a non-Christian warrior. 

These codes of conducts are the background for the elaborate set of rules and codes of conduct that come to dominate courtly literature in the 12th century and the famous virtue known as "Chivalry" (we will see this when we get to Chretien de Troyes and the ideas of “courtly love”.)

## The Call to Arms: Christian Kingdom and the Creation of the Other.

The other, perhaps more obvious, strategy to help control the emerging warrior class is: give them an external outward enemy and focus their military energy on strengthening the new "Catholic" (that is pro-papal) world-order rather than weakening it with internal strife.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

With all this background in mind, let's look at the substance of Pope Urban's Council of Clermont speech (pp. 25-37), calling for crusade. 

What I would like to look for is evidence of this "new" argument for military activity as a Christian virtue (or the "spiritualizing of military activity") in the accounts of Pope Urban’s speech.

{:.rquestion}
What is the "theological argument" for the Crusade that he gives?

{:.rquestion}
What are the key premises in the argument?

{:.rquestion}
How are traditional Christian Bible verses or Biblical precepts (that could be easily be used as a call to pacifism or monasticism) re-interpreted as a justification of the crusade and the life of war and violence?

{:.rquestion}
Where does Pope Urban look for models and exemplar?

{:.rquestion}
Is this evidence of a new vision of a pilgrim's proper involvement with the earthly city? How so?
</div>

# Key Takeaways

* We detailed the decline of the Carolingian Empire and how it lead to two problems in the 10th and 11th centuries.
  * Proprietary churches and lay abbacies.
  * A professional warrior class
* We discussed the Investiture Controversy as new paradigm of church-state relations arising directly out of the world-view seen in Cluniac Reforms.
* And we saw how this new paradigm put a new onus on the church to deal with the political problems that were resulting from the new unruly military class.
* Finally, we saw how both the Peace and Truce of God and the call for Crusade could be seen as part of a political strategy on the part of the church to meet its new political obligations to maintain and enforce domestic peace.

# What's Next

* Next we will trace the timeline and main of events of the First Crusade, making sure to compare closely the way the Crusade is explained and justified in theory to the way it is lived out and executed in practice.
