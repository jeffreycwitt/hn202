# Intro

Today, we’re beginning a short inquiry into the life and achievements of Charlemagne or Charles the Great. We also want to see Charlemagne's life in the context of the geo-political events that surrounded his reign. Here's a possible way to break down this period into smaller units.

* From Merovingian to Carolingian Period (485-751)
* The First Carolingian King (r. 751-768)
* The Rule of Charlemagne (r. 768-814)
* The Decline of the Carolingian Empire (814-10th century)


# The Merovingian Dynasty 

Before the "Carolingian Era", we speak of the Merovingian Dynasty (486-751).

While he has some predecessors, the Merovingian Dynasty is thought to have really been established with the reign of Clovis I (481-511). 

This map shows the territory of the Franks under the rule of Clovis.

![early kingdoms]({{site.assets_url}}earlyKingdoms.png)

(See also SHMA, p. 26 and map 1.6).

This ruling family continues from the 5th century to the 8th century, finally ending with Childric III in 751.

## The Merovingian Decline

What is important for our story is that we recognize that, toward the end of this dynasty, the power and influence of these kings was already waning.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.dquestion}
What does Einhard tell us about the Merovingians of the 8th century? (see pp. 18-19).

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

* During the final hundred years (650-750), Merovingian rule is ineffective. 
* Einhard suggests that they possessed kingship in name only. 
* People knew that if you wanted something done, you shouldn’t go to King, you should go to someone else.
* (Also Merovingians had “long hair”)

</div>
</div>

Why does it weaken?

1. Possibly, there is personal weakness. Kingdoms in the west, which lacked rigorous bureaucracies, were generally united through personalities. Thus, it was charisma and strength that garnered loyalty and devotion.
2. Perhaps they simply ran out of money with which they might procure the favor needed to get things done.
   * Remember, in this system there is no real taxation or coinage because taxation requires large stable bureaucratic systems. 
   * Therefore, being rich and being able to procure favors with that wealth primarily meant having land and being able to distribute that land. 
   * Land (unlike coinage) cannot be continuously divided and remain valuable. 
     * e.g. I‘m happy to take half of your $100, but I’m not interested in half of your house.

## The Mayors of the Palace

This weakening of the Merovingian Kings helps explain why rivals to the dynasty emerge. 

It happens that these kings had many servants. This included servants who were put in charge of the entire household including executive functions like managing household wealth, defense, and other military tasks. As such, they had the ability to become extremely powerful through management and conquest.

The leaders of these military units were referred to as the “Mayors the Palace”.

Here's a map that shows some of the "sub-kingdoms" of the Frankish territory. Each such "sub-kingdom" would have had a "Mayor of the Palace".

![early kingdoms]({{site.assets_url}}neustria-austrasia.jpg)

As the Merovingian dynasty grew older, the Mayors increasingly wielded the actual effective power, and the kings functioned in many ways as titular figureheads.

If you need an example, you might think about the relationship between the current British Monarchy and the British Prime Minister and Parliament.

In our case, the emergence of Carolingian power comes from their ancestral status as the Mayors of the Palace of Austrasia (the northeast part of the Frankish lands.)

A particularly good example of this imbalance of power involves us in the event we discussed last class: the Battle of Tours in 732.

We’ve already noted that Islamic forces were expanding into Frankish territory. But the Frankish (Merovingian) kings could do very little stop them. 

Charles Martel was the Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia at this time. And it was Charles who was able to rally fighters and meet the Umayyad forces in battle. 

Charles Martel was the father of Pippin the Small or Pippin the Younger. Pippin (714-768) succeeded Charles Martel as Mayor of the Palace in Austrasia. 

In 751, Pippin recognized the weakness of the Merovingian King and worked to depose him. He removed the last Merovingian King (Childric III) from his position and declared himself King of the Franks. 

Thus ends the Merovingian Dynasty and begins what we call the Carolingian Era.

# Pippin and the Challenge of Establishing Legitimacy

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.dquestion}
What kind of political problems face a usurper who attempts to overthrow a preceding dynasty? What does such a person have to establish?
 
<div class="answer" markdown="1">
The change of dynasty required that Pippin go out of his way to establish his legitimacy as the true king.

This part of the story is important because it dramatically affects how Europe is shaped going forward. 
</div>

{:.dquestion}
Does Rosenwein provide any suggestions about how Pippin establish his legitimacy?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

He does at least two things. 

1. First: He wins a lot of battles, thereby displaying military legitimacy.
2. Second: he looks for a religious justification of his legitimacy. He aligns himself with the Church, particularly with the papacy (the bishop of Rome).

</div>

</div>

## The 8th Century Papacy

We need to realize that at this time the papacy is not very strong. 

Because the Pope lived in Rome, he was the inheritor of many symbols of old Roman power. And for this reason, he was important.

But he doesn’t have the kind of pan-European political influence that we see in the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries.

As we can see in the map below, the 8th century papacy is fairly isolated.

![8th cent papacy]({{site.assets_url}}8thCentPapacy.png)

Nor does the Pope have particularly strong military support. 

At the very same time that Pippin was looking for ways to establish legitimacy, Pope Stephen II was in desperate need of military support. (See also SHMA pp. 59, map 2.4).

And here’s another connection to something we already know. 

Previously, the the Pope in Rome had relied on military protection against tribes like the Lombards from the Byzantine Empire.

{:.question}
But what kind of challenge is the Byzantine Empire facing at the very same time that the Pope needs help (anywhere between 711 and 800)?

{:.answer}
Attacks from the emerging Islamic Empire. For example, the second Umayyad siege of Constantinople in 717 (there was also a prior siege in 674: see [wikipedia for list of sieges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sieges_of_Constantinople) and various other battles on the borders between the Byzantine and Abbasid empire after 750.

{:.question} 
What else is happening internally around 750 in Byzantium? 

{:.answer}
The Iconoclasm movement is underway; and this movement is not particularly appreciated by the Pope (See SHMA, c. 2, top of pg. 48). 

## The Donation of Pippin

Thus, we have TWO parties, both in need of something from the other. 

Pippin is very good at fighting but needs to establish legitimacy. Pope Stephen holds a position of recognized authority but has very little military strength.

In 753, Pope Stephen II offers to support Pippin in exchange for help in Italy. Pippin consents and invades Italy to help protect Pope Stephen II from Lombard invasions. Tradition refers to this concession as the “donation of Pippin” in 756 (see SHMA, p. 104). 

In exchange for his services, Pope Stephen II in 754 "re-crowns" Pippin King (giving him the legitimacy he needs). 

This agreement or exchange is referred to as a “donation” because tradition holds that Pippin gave the land he took back from the Lombards directly to the Pope. 

It is this donation that was used as a justification for the independent sovereignty of the papal “states” – several territories in Italy that were directly ruled by the Pope from the 8th century to 1870. 

Here is a simple map showing the continued direct control of these territories by the Church in 1796:

![papal states 1796](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Italy_1796.svg/1920px-Italy_1796.svg.png)

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Let's pause for a moment here and ask:

{:.rquestion}
What "pilgrim" tensions are raised by the Bishop of Rome becoming a direct sovereign of temporal territories?

{:.rquestion}
Where does this kind of involvement with the earthly city put us on the "pilgrim spectrum" from "seclusion" to "endurance" to "realization")? 

{:.rquestion}
Does this suggest an Augustinian view of the proper relationship between Christianity and the earthly city? Why or why not?

</div>

Finally, it is important to stress the larger geo-political point here: 

By looking to the north and west for protection rather than to the Byzantine east, we are witnessing a critical and ongoing **geo-political shift**. The growing weakness of the Byzantine Empire and the rise of the Islamic Empire in the east, pushed the popes to look north and west for protection. This solidified a papal connection with Western Europe that dominated the rest of the Middle Ages (and even the present day)!

(Consider the maps in SHMA on p. 43 and p. 59 for Byzantine ownership and compare these to map 3.4 on p. 105).

This shift, usually marked at 752-756 (from the time Pope Stephen called for help until the donation of Pepin), is sometimes referred to as the shift from the Byzantine Papacy to the Frankish Papacy.

The Byzantine period was a period in which most of the Popes were Greek and Popes generally sought and needed the approval of the Byzantine Emperor to become Pope. 

The alliance between Pope Stephen and Pippin initiates the Frankish Papacy, in which the papacy will be aligned with the west and therefore will have considerably more influence over the west (and very little influence in the east). From this point on, most Popes will now be Frankish. And in turn, western rulers like Pippin and Charles, as protectors of the papal states, will exert considerable influence over who becomes Pope.

In 768, when Pippin dies, he is succeeded by his sons Carloman and Charles. Carloman dies in 771, and Charles is left as the sole king of the Franks. 

Thus, we meet Charles the Great or Charlemagne.

# Einhard's Biography

Before looking at any details of Charlemagne's life, it worth reflecting on one of our main primary sources: Einhard's Biography.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
What role do historical biographies play in our own society and present self-identity?

Our introduction (see Ganz, p. 5) notes that this biography became immensely popular as a school textbook; students, for example, would use this book to learn how to read Latin.

{:.rquestion}
What kinds of books about historical figures did you read a child, perhaps as part of a school exercise? How did those books shape your adult consciousness about history (and in turn your adult consciousness of the present)? What kind of "spin" did those stories have? What kind of events did they emphasize? What kind of events did they leave out?

{:.rquestion}
Similarly, what kind of portrait of Charlemagne does Einhard paint? How might this effect future "adult" ideas about Charlemagne, the Carolingians, or even the concept of Europe or "The West"?

{:.rquestion}
Finally, according to the introduction, why was Einhard’s biography, in its own time, seen as controversial? What is the substance of this criticism? (See Ganz, p. 6)

{:.dquestion}
Does this criticism reflect any trends or ideas we have already seen before?

{:.answer}
Sulpicius worries about the benefit or utility of a secular biography praising the worldly deeds of a political figure. Thus, it operates with the idea of a proper pilgrimage as one of separation from the world and political activity.

{:.rquestion}
Does Einhard's choice to memorialize the political activity of Charlemagne introduce a new perspective on what a Christian pilgrimage should look like? In light of this biography, should we find it surprising that some 200 years later Pope Urban II will invoke Charlemagne's memory when calling for the first crusade?

# The Reign of Charles the Great

## Military and Political Success

* Rosenwein notes (SHMA, p. 102) that, despite not being able to collect land taxes or have salaried officials or a standing army, Franks were able to achieve something similar to what was being achieved by Byzantium and the Abbasids in the 9th century. How was this possible? 
  * Rosenwein notes: "the answer is at least threefold: 1) the Carolingians took advantage of the same gentle economic upturn that seems to have taken place generally; 2) they **exploited to the full the institutions of Roman culture** and political life that remained to them; 3) and at the same time, they were willing to **experiment with new institutions** and take advantage of unexpected opportunities" (SHMA, p. 102).

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
Where do we see examples of claims 2 (exploiting Roman culture) and 3 (experimenting with new institutions) in Einhard's depiction of Charlemagne's reign? Can you point us to some helpful primary source passage?

</div>


<!-- Within this in the background, I'd like to make a list of some other main characteristics Charlemagne's Reign. (If I'm missing something, please suggest other achievements that seem significant (and be sure to tell us why))

* Characteristics of his rule
  * Tremendously successful as a war leader
  * Exploits connection with Church
    * He is a Christian Ruler, this includes forced conversion of subjects and continuation of the alliance of the Church started by his Father Pippin.
    * But he seems himself and spiritually responsible for his subjects.
    * Feels a responsibility to educate the citizenry
  * Carolingian Renaissance
    * Uses church infrastructure, to develop schools associated with big cathedrals (deep rooms of the rise of the university)
    * Uses church learning to standardize latin script
  * Similarities with Rome, influence of Imperial Tradition
    * SHMA, p. 100, "drawing on imperial traditions, Charlemagne issued laws in the form of "capitularies"
    * The Legacy of Rome; He is crowned emperor and this harks back to the era of the Roman Caesars. He is now, at least symbolically, emperor and not just king of the Franks, but ruler of many different people and over many different kings.
    * Einhard's biography is in the tradition of the "lives of the Ceasars" (SHMA, p. 99)
    * But there are differences from Rome as well. 
    * SHMA, p. 100: paid people with land grants, rather than salaries (which is NOT roman)
    * The base of his empire is no longer in Rome or even Italy. But in Austrasia, and the town of his Royal Palace Aachen.
    * We can see traces of this shift today, as we notice the centrality of places like Brussels for the European Union, the importance of Northern France and even Paris shows that Charlemagne’s rule affects even the shape of geo-political relations today.
  * Unites Church and Imperial traditions together
    * Pope Leo, “surprise” coronation at Rome in 800.
    * "Holy Roman Emperor" is a new kind of title.
  * Question: What are the implications of being crowned by a Pope?
    * It could be implied that the Pope is more powerful and is giving power to you. One might also think that if the Pope can give power to you, he can also take it away.
  
  
Question: How does the Donation of Constantine fit into this Papal vision?
Question: How does Charlmagne's name for himself ("emperor, crowned by God") try to put a differents spin on this. (see SHMA, p. 100, bottom

This tension would be harbinger of the Investiture controversy in the 11th century. -->

## The Carolingian Renaissance

Besides military conquests, Charlemagne's name is often associated with the "Carolingian Renaissance". To understand the Carolingian Renaissance we need to keep in mind the stark reality of lay culture in the early Middle Ages. The "radical simplification of material culture" that occurs after the fall of Rome includes the disappearances of lay literacy.

To some extent I think this makes a lot of sense. If books are so scarce that a huge collection consists of little more than a hundred books, it is not surprising that many people have never seen a book. Accordingly, it makes sense that very little value is placed on the ability to read.

I myself find it a little surprising to learn that Charlemagne, despite being famous for initiating these reforms and being from a powerful family, really grew up illiterate and was forced to try to learn how to read as an adult. 

Some specific cultural reforms we should highlight include:

* Ecclesiastical reforms throughout the empire, specifically standardization of liturgy.

{:.rquestion}
While seemingly "religious" in nature, can you see any political benefits or motivations for this kind of "standardization"? What needed to be standardized? What problems might occur if things were not standardized?

We can see many of the following reforms as indirect consequences of the above. Namely, in order to standardize liturgy across the empire, the following reforms would likely also be necessary.

* A mandate that each Bishop create a school (the beginnings of the “cathedral school”) (see Ganz, intro, p. xv.)
  * This is particularly important as an "early seed" of the future universities that we see in the high and late Middle Ages.

* Grammar books and rules for recognizing proper Latin.

* Standardization of Latin scripts (a standardization which influences the scripts we continue to use today).
  * This includes the preservation of the Latin alphabet we are more or less used to as opposed to Germanic scripts (where we see things like ß) and later Gothic scripts.
    * The promotion and use of the “minuscule” (lowercase letters) scripts that we use today as opposed to the "majuscule" (uppercase letters). 
    * The focus on minuscule also promoted the use of white space between words and clear rounded characters.

Here's an example of a 9th century Carolingian script compared to a late 14th century Gothic script.

This first picture is from a religious book (called a "Sacramentary") created during the 9th century just after Charlemagne's death.

![Carolingian Script ]({{site.assets_url}}carolingianScript.png)

The text reads: 

"Per dominum nostrum ihesum christum filium tuum"

Contrast that to the much later 14th century cursive Gothic script: 

![Gothic 14th Century Script ]({{site.assets_url}}Gothic14thCenturyScript.png)

which reads:

"Posset vel hoc esset ex parte dei omnipotentis volentis cogere eam et hoc non quia"

Compare, for example, the "d"s in both scripts. The Carolingian script has the upright "d" that we are used to, while the Gothic script has a tilted "d" with an elaborate loop. 

Again, if you can find an "a" in both scripts (perhaps in the word "turbatione" above the main line in the Carolingian script, and the word "eam" in the Gothic script), you can see that the font I'm using to type this very sentence resembles the "two compartment 'a'" seen in the Carolingian script and differs from the "one compartment 'a'" seen in the Gothic script. 

While the Gothic script came to dominate in the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries, the modern era reverted back to the earlier Carolingian script. This helps explain why we write our words and letters the way we do today.

# Key Takeaways

  * The weakness of the Merovingian Kings
  * The growing strength of the "Mayors of the Palace"
  * What this means for geo-politics, specifically for the position of Rome and the papacy in Europe.
  * The transition from the Byzantine to the Frankish papacy
* The role that biography plays in shaping cultural ideas
* Charlemagne's military and cultural achievements

# What's Next

* Next time we will look at the decline and, ultimately, fragmentation of the Carolingian Empire.
* This fragmentation will help us explain the new conditions leading up to the call for the First Crusade at the end of the 10th century.
