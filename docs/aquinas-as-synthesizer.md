# Introduction

Today, we're going to continue with our "Scholasticism Week". And for this class we're going focus on perhaps the most famous scholastic theology, Thomas Aquinas. 

As a goal for today, I want to introduce just **one main point** and then illustrate that point with some examples.

The "one point" is: "Thomas Aquinas is famous for being an intellectual *synthesizer* at precisely the time when the Christian intellectual tradition needed such a synthesizer."

This raises some sub-questions: 

1. What needed to be synthesized? 
2. And how did he do it?

# 1. What needed to be synthesized?

Thomas Aquinas was a Dominican philosopher and theologian who taught at the nascent University of Paris in the 13th century.

At precisely this time in the 13th century a quasi intellectual crises was emerging.

Let me explain this in three points:

## The Loss of Aristotle

It is not always easy to appreciate that the works of Plato and especially Aristotle were virtually lost to the west until the mid-13th century. 

A few early works of Aristotle had survived the turmoil of the politically unstable early Middle Ages, but most of Aristotle's corpus was completely unknown to thinkers in the Latin world for nearly 6 hundred years.

Imagine that the works of Galileo, Newton, or Einstein had been lost and then were suddenly found 600 years later by a society that had not advanced beyond their work. Imagine what a loss that would have been. And perhaps more important, imagine how exciting it would have been to suddenly discover their works.

This discovery included Aristotle’s *Ethics* as well as most of all of his speculative works, the *Physics*, the *Metaphysics*, *On the Heavens*, etc.

{:.rquestion}
So where had the texts of Aristotle gone? 

As we know, in the 9th and 10th centuries, the Middle East was thriving. Places like Baghdad were the intellectual powerhouses. It was here that Plato and Aristotle continued to be read, studied, and commented on.

We also know that the Iberian Peninsula was held by Muslims during this time and was a primarily Arabic speaking land. So as time went on, the works of Aristotle and the Arabic commentaries were making their way to Spain. And it is through contact with Spain that Aristotle was re-introduced to Western Europe. In the mid-thirteenth century, modern day Spain was being re-conquered by Western European Christians, and, as a consequence, the works of Aristotle, which Islamic thinkers had known for centuries, finally found their way to places like France, Italy, and England.

## Christian Thought Before the Recovery of Aristotle

At the same time, we should also keep in mind that it is not as though intellectual work was not being done in western Europe. 

Western Christian thinkers and intellectuals were constructing their own view of the universe and humanity's place within it.

Anselm (fl. late 11th, early 12th century, died in 1109), the monk and eventually abbot of Canterbury, is a great representative of this. He probably knew little to nothing about Aristotle's *Ethics*. Thus, he developed his own theories about the soul and the will in conversation with Augustine and the Bible rather than in conversation with Aristotle.

## Western Europe’s initial response to the re-discovery of Aristotle

The rediscovery was both an exciting and disconcerting development for Latin intellectuals. 

On the one hand, the complete and integrated world-view of Aristotle was utterly astonishing. 

Aristotle seemingly had a consistent natural theory for everything. To read Aristotle was to be given plausible answers for almost every phenomenon and mystery one could think of.

On the other hand, this complete and self-contained world-view was disconcerting. Aristotle was not a Christian after all. 

None of his theories were informed by revealed texts. And often his system, his theory of everything, was at odds with what Christians took to be divinely (and therefore infallibly) revealed truths. 

For instance: Aristotle did not believe that the world had a beginning, but he believed that it was eternal. He did not believe in a resurrection or afterlife, and nor did he have anything to say about God as a Trinity or anything similar. 

Accordingly, the power and attractiveness of his system, as well as the seeming inconsistencies with the Christian doctrine, made his work threatening. 

This was so much the case that an early statute of the University of Paris in 1210 was written just as Aristotle’s corpus was emerging. The statute claimed: 

> "that reading Aristotle’s work on Natural Philosophy, in public or in private, was forbidden at Paris."

{:.question}
So what usually happens when you ban a text? 

{:.answer}
Everyone rushes to read it.

Needless to say, the statute was rather ineffective. However, it illustrated the need for someone to harmonize Aristotle’s worldview and the "Christian" worldview.

Enter Thomas Aquinas.

Part of Thomas Aquinas’s legacy is that he spent much of his life trying to explain how Aristotle was **not** a threat to the Christian religion. In other words, he attempted to synthesize the two traditions. His work is a long exercise in showing how the Aristotelian world-view is compatible (though not identical) with the teaching of revealed truth.

More broadly speaking, in effecting this synthesis, he was arguing for a kind of happy compatibility between science and religion, philosophy and theology, reason and faith.

This debate fits into one of our big course themes: namely life as a pilgrimage. We've noted frequently some of the political ramifications of this disposition. 

However, there are also implications for how we relate to knowledge. We've seen some of these implications in Cassiodorus or the Islamic debates about the right use and interpretation of the Hadith. 

If we're on a journey, and if knowledge is kind of map, we might ask: what use is natural knowledge (a map of earth), if we're trying to get somewhere not on earth (i.e the next life)? Don't we need a "supernatural" map? Does this mean that the "earthly map" is a mere a distraction? Or is there way "natural knowledge" can assist us on our pilgrim journey?

# 2. The Synthesis

So, with that background in mind, I want to try to illustrate the kind of synthesis Aquinas makes by looking at two positions. 

First, I want look at his position on the nature of truth and the kinds of truth available to human beings. Then secondly, I want to turn to his position on the nature of happiness (which was the focus of our reading for today).

## Aquinas on Truth

First, we can observe that Aquinas divided truth into two types:

> "there exists a twofold truth concerning the divine being, one to which the inquiry of the reason can reach, the other which surpasses the whole ability of the human reason." (SCG, I, c. 4)

The former group he called the "Preambles of Faith"

The latter group he referred to as the "Articles of Faith"

### Preambles of Faith 

Those propositions that are classified as "Preambles of Faith" are those that the inquiry of reason can, **in principle**, reach.

{:.rquestion}
If reason can reach these truths (for example that God exists), and can demonstrate them, why should they be revealed at all? Why shouldn’t we just be expected to figure them out for ourselves?

Aquinas asks precisely this question: 

> "it is fitting that both of these truths be proposed to man divinely for belief. This point must first be shown concerning the truth that is open to the inquiry of the reason; otherwise, it might perhaps seem to someone that, since such a truth can be known by reason, it was uselessly given to men through supernatural inspiration as an object of belief" (SCG, I, c. 4)

Aquinas gives three reasons.

1) Despite our ability to get there in principle, few people would actually demonstrate these truths for themselves. Some lack personality or physical ability for such work, some do not have time – because a temporal concern weighs them down (i.e. feeding their family, protecting their community, etc.), some are lazy.

It interesting to think about revealed religion as a kind of reaction to what we might call, for lack of a better term, the Aristocratic nature of philosophy.

Aristotle is fairly willing to say that those who are not lucky enough to be born with the time or talent to pursue philosophy simply miss out on the knowledge of these essential truths.

But for Aquinas, God wants everyone to be happy and is willing to give people this knowledge even if they don’t have the time or energy to work for it. 

2) It takes a long time, to reach this knowledge, yet this knowledge is necessary for truly ethical living. And if we don't have this knowledge in advance we could easily be led astray or fail to practice the virtue that his knowledge demands.
 
3) We need this knowledge so that we can be certain. Usually our demonstrations have a mixture of error in them. Thus, even when we are hitting the truth, we are bringing in errors with us. And these errors bring about lots of disagreement. And this disagreement would bring about lots of uncertainty, even about those things that are true and are truly demonstrated. 

Here, I think we can see the roots of a fairly common criticism of philosophy or human science in general. It is that even the smartest people are sometimes completely wrong and fooled into thinking they have knowledge (or a true demonstration) when they only have a false opinion that looks like knowledge.

At the time Aquinas was writing, this criticism was voiced by pointing to diversity of conflicting opinions given by the world's smartest people. If one remains a committed rationalist (trusting only what could be demonstrated by human beings) they would easily find themselves in a world full of conflicting but supposedly demonstrated truths.

Revelation of these truths is therefore seen as a divine mercy. Not because these truths can't be known **in principle** by natural reason, but because human beings usually arrive at such truths with a mixture of error and falsity.

### Articles of Faith Proper

With respect to genuine "articles of faith", we naturally might ask how they differ from the "preambles of faith"?

They are truths that cannot be demonstrated, even in principle. 

But importantly, they **cannot** conflict or contradict the "preambles of faith". In this way, Aquinas finds a kind of middle position between the "Rationalist" and "Fideist" position. Through this middle position religion need not fear the truths of reason, but can also resist the totalizing claims of natural reason (or can even assist and guide natural reason).

It is at this point that Aquinas distances himself from extreme rationalism in two ways.

1) The extreme rationalists might claim that all truths can in principle be known by the natural human intellect. (I emphasize in principle -- because even the rationalist might admit that this is very difficult and will take a long time.) However, they would also claim that if the human species remained in existence for an infinite amount of time, then all the laws and universal truths of the universe could eventually be demonstrated.

2) The second thing that the "less extreme" rationalist would claim is that there is no truth that nature requires us to know, which nature has not given us the ability to know.

Aquinas is responding to the above two claims in the following way: 

A1) Aquinas is here saying that there are a set of truths about the world that reason could not demonstrate (or know with certainty) no matter how much time and effort was devoted to proving it.

A2) But he goes further to insist that this class of non-demonstrable truths is **necessary** for happiness (or certain conception of happiness), and thus revelation of the strict "articles of faith" becomes necessary for human happiness.

This is, therefore, a great place to transition to Aquinas' discussion of happiness because the division of the two truths begs the questions: why should we care about those truths that lie behind human knowability? What do we need them for?

Again Aquinas anticipates this concern: 

> "Perhaps some will think that men should not be asked to believe what the reason is not adequate to investigate, since the divine wisdom provides in the case of each thing according to the mode of its nature" (SCG, I, c. 5).

In response, we can see where Aquinas is headed:

> "But, as we shall examine later on in this work, men are ordained by the divine Providence towards a higher good than human fragility can experience in the present life." (SCG, I, c. 5)

## Aquinas on Happiness 

So, let’s now turn to the controversy about the nature of happiness that needs synthesizing.

We must first remember that Aristotle stands as the pre-eminent personification of natural "reason". So his views typically stand for what reason can discover and demonstrate.

It is the general Aristotelian view that happiness, in principle, was something achievable in this life -- primarily through the practice of natural virtue which can be acquired through the exercise of natural reason.

However, we must also remember that Aquinas is required to synthesize two traditions: Greek Philosophy on the one hand and the Christian tradition on the other hand.

So in addition to the claims of Aristotle, Aquinas has to show how these are compatible with the claims of Augustine.

Let's remind ourselves what Augustine says about virtue and happiness in this life.

> "Then again, what of virtue itself, which is not one of the primary gifts, since it supervenes on them later, introduced by teaching? Although it claims the topmost place among human goods, what is its activity in this world but unceasing warfare with vices, and those not external vices but internal, not other people's vices but quite clearly our own, our very own? And this is the particularly struggle of the virtue called in Greek sophrosune, which is translated temperance -- the virtue which bridles the lusts of the flesh to prevent their gaining the consent of the mind and dragging it into every kind of immorality. For it is never true, in this life, that vice does not exist, when, as the Apostle says, 'the desires of the flesh oppose the spirit'; but to this vice there is an opposing virtue, when, as the same Apostle says, 'the desires of the spirit oppose the flesh. For these two are in mutual opposition, so that you do not achieve." (XIX, c. 4 p. 853)

> "And what of that virtue called prudence? Does she not employ all her vigilance in distinguishing good from evil, so that in our pursuit of the good and our endeavour to shun the evil...And does not she herself thus testify that we are in the midst of evils, or rather that evils are in us" (XIX, c. 4 p. 853)

> "...Does not justice demonstrate, in performing this function, that she is still labouring at her task rather than resting after reaching its completion." (XIX, c. 4, p. 854)

> "As, therefore, we are saved in hope, it is in hope that we have been made happy; and as we do not yet possess a present salvation, but await salvation in the future, so we do not enjoy a present happiness, but look forward to happiness in the future, and we look forward 'with steadfast endurance'. We are beset by evils, and we have to endure them steadfastly until we reach those goods where there will be everything to supply us with delight beyond the telling, and there will be nothing any longer that we are bound to endure. Such is the salvation which in the world to come will also be itself the ultimate bliss. Yet these philosophies refuse to believe in this blessedness because they do not see it; and so they attempt to fabricate for themselves an utterly delusive happiness by means of a virtue whose falsity is in proportion to its arrogance." (XIX, c. 4, p. 857)

I take this view to be fairly representative of the Christian, Biblical, Theological tradition that Aquinas inherits. 

In these passages, more than anything else, the one idea that stands out is the idea that the primary task in this life is to "endure in the good" despite a harsh world of temptation. Rather than seek an elusive and illusory earthly happiness, one ought to strive to be just. And once a person has proven themselves in this way, they may hope to receive happiness in a future life.

So how does Aquinas deal with this apparent contradiction? How can he say that these two traditions are both true and yet not in a contradiction, but perfectly compatible? How can he have it both ways?

Let's look first at his question "Can one be happy in this life" and the fundamental distinction he makes.

> "Some participation can be had in this life, but true and perfect happiness cannot be had in this life" (ST, I-II, q. 5, a. 3, p. 57)

Here he appeals to the same chapter of Augustine we just read:

> "This can be shown in two ways. The first way is taken from the common notion of happiness, for happiness, since it is the "complete and sufficient good" excludes all evil and fulfills all desire...." (ST, I-II, q. 5, a. 3, p. 57)

So, is this an outright rejection of Aristotle (and reason) in favor of faith? Or is there still some truth to what Aristotle was saying?

Consider q. 5, a. 3, obj. 3:

> "What is said by man cannot be wholly false, for what is in many seems to be natural and nature does not wholly fail..." (ST, I-II, q. 5, a. 3, obj. 3)

and then the response to objection 3:

> "Men [e.g. Aristotle] think there is some happiness in this life because of a similarity of it to true happiness. They are not altogether wrong in so thinking". (ST, I-II, q. 5, a. 3, ad 3)

So how does he recognize/synthesize these two positions? In a fashion typical of the "scholastic dialectical method" he makes a distinction. A distinction between: **imperfect happiness** vs. **perfect happiness**, between **natural happiness** and **supernatural happiness**.

With this in mind, let’s look closer at q. 5, article 5.

Aristotle says we can achieve happiness with our natural powers. And we can see this reflected in the initial objections: 

> "Nature is not lacking in what is necessary. But nothing is as necessary as that by which the ultimate end is attained. Therefore this is not lacking to human nature. Hence man can attain happiness by his natural powers." (ST, I-II, q. 5, a. 5, obj. 1)

The *Sed Contra* reveals the opposing Augustinian view:

> "Man is the principle of his actions by intellect and will, which are natural powers. But the ultimate happiness which is prepared for the saints surpasses the intellect and will of man, for the Apostle says, ‘eye has not seen nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man, what things God has prepared for those who love him" (1 Cor 2:9). Therefore, man cannot attain happiness by natural powers." (ST, I-II, q. 5, a. 5, sed contra)

But how then does Aquinas straighten this out so that there is no contradiction, but complete "compatibility"?

> "The imperfect happiness which man can have in this life can be acquired by his natural powers, as can virtue, which is the activity happiness consists in." (ST, I-II, q. 5, a. 5, resp.)

> "But, as we have already said, man’s perfect happiness consists in the vision of the divine essence. Now to see the essence of God is beyond the nature not only of man but of every creature..." (ST, I-II, q. 5, a. 5, resp.)

In this way, Aquinas has reconciled the claim of reason and the claim of revelation, which at first seemed contradictory. He tries to show that the reason and revelation are really making **two different claims**, which are perfectly compatible and harmonious. 

Everything that Aristotle said about happiness can still be applied and quite useful. But we must remember that his advice and counsel is only relevant to the achievement of "imperfect" or "natural" happiness.

But the claim of the Christian/Biblical/Augustinian tradition, that happiness is not achievable in this life, is also true because now we are talking about "perfect" happiness or "supernatural" happiness, which goes beyond what reason can show us or demonstrate to us.

# Political Consequences

Finally, it worth noting how Aquinas's synthesis, particularly on the question of happiness informs political philosophy. 

Dante, famous for his poetry, was also deeply involved in politics, and he wrote a book called "De Monarchia".

At the time of his writing in the early 14th century, papal power (and the "theocratic" or "hierocratic" view of government) was reaching its apex. 

Dante opposed this view and wanted to argue for the divine appointment of the secular monarchy (the Holy Roman Emperor) alongside the spiritual power granted to the Pope. As we will see, he uses Aquinas's synthesis to do this.

Dante writes:

> "Therefore, to complete the task we set ourselves, we must give a 'positive' proof that the emperor, or world ruler, is **directly dependent** on the prince of the universe, who is God." (De Monarchia, III, 16 (p. 91)).

> "In order to understand this it must be borne in mind that man alone among created beings is the link between corruptible and incorruptible things; and thus he is rightly compared by philosophers to the horizon, which is the link between two hemispheres." (De Monarchia, III, 16 (p. 91)).

This is a great image, almost poetic in a way, but what does he mean? How is the human person both corruptible and incorruptible?

> "for if he is considered body, man is corruptible; if he is considered only in terms of one, his soul, he is incorruptible." (De Monarchia, III, 16 (p. 91)).

> "thus if man is a kind of link between corruptible and incorruptible things, since every such link shares something of the nature of the extremes it unites, man must have something of both natures." (De Monarchia, III, 16 (p. 92)).

{:.rquestion}
So, human beings appear to have a kind of **DUAL NATURE**, but why is it important to Dante's argument to assert that human beings have a dual nature?

If we are good Aristotelians and we think that there are TWO NATURES, we would of course expect to find two ends (two *teloi*) or purposes. To be a substance or nature for Aristotle is to have a function. No nature exists without a function, otherwise this would suggest a kind of randomness or purposelessness in the universe. 

And this is just what Dante says:

> "And since every nature is ordered towards its own ultimate goal, it follows that man’s goal is twofold; so that, just as he alone among all created beings shares in incorruptibility and corruptibility, so he alone among all created beings is ordered to two ultimate goals, one of them being his goal as a corruptible being, the other his goal as an incorruptible being." (De Monarchia, III, 16 (p. 92)).

{:.rquestion}
What then are these two goals?

Following Aquinas, they are happiness in this life (prefigured in earthly paradise), and happiness in the next life (beatific vision)

Each of which are achieved by completely different means corresponding to the distinct difference between these two ends.

The next question is what are the distinct means to achieve these two different goals. And here is where Dante makes the political connection.

> "Now these two kinds of happiness must be reached by different means, as representing different ends. For we attain the first through the teachings of philosophy, provided that we follow them putting into practice the moral and intellectual virtues..." (De Monarchia, III, 16 (p. 92)).

> "Whereas we attain the second through spiritual teachings which transcend human reason provided that we follow them putting into practice the theological virtues, i.e., faith, hope, and charity" (De Monarchia, III, 16 (p. 92)).

So, we have the normal, naturally acquired, moral virtues (cardinal virtues) that deal with happiness in this life and which correspond to our mortal corruptible nature.

But then we have three other virtues, which are given or infused by God (theological virtues) and cannot be acquired naturally.

And Dante goes on to make the final political connection.

> "Yet human greed would cast these ends and means aside if men, like horses, prompted to wander by their animal natures, were not held in check ‘with bit and bridle’ on their journey." (De Monarchia, III, 16 (p. 92)).

So here we have the great image of people who wander off away from the most immediate pain and toward the most immediate pleasure: that is, unless they are kept in check by a kind of master.

> "It is for this reason that man had need of **two guides** corresponding to his twofold goal: that is to say the **supreme Pontiff**, to lead mankind to eternal life in conformity with revealed truth, and **the emperor**, to guide mankind to temporal happiness in conformity with the teachings of philosophy. And since none can reach this harbor (or few, and these few with great difficulty) unless the waves of seductive greed are calmed and the human race rests free in the tranquility of peace, this is the goal which the protector of the world, who is called the Roman prince, must strive with all his might to bring about: i.e. that life on this threshing-floor of mortals may be lived freely and in peace" (De Monarchia, III, 16 (p. 92-93)).

In this way, Dante uses the idea that we are oriented to two kinds of happiness as justification for two kinds of independent political power. 

# Key Takeaways

* Today, we focused on one main point: Why Thomas Aquinas is considered a "synthesizer"?
* To tackle this question, we first needed to consider what needed to be synthesized.
* Then we looked out how this synthesis was made.
  * Aquinas' method was generally to identify places of apparent conflict between faith and reason, and then explain through fine-grained distinctions that the apparent conflict was **only apparent**. If we look closely enough, we can see that the seemingly incompatible claims are talking about two different things.
  * We observed this in two examples: on Truth and on Happiness.
  * Finally, we looked at the political consequence of this dual view of happiness as seen in Dante's *De Monarchia*

# What's Next

* Next class, we'll continue our "Scholasticism Week" by reviewing Aristotle's Ethics and discussing how it will inform the moral framework we see illustrated in Dante's *Purgatorio*
