## Themes

* Pilgrimage
  * How does Augustine set the stage for the idea of life as a pilgrimage?
  * Where do we see this idea embodied and enacted throughout the Middle Ages? In what different ways does it manifest itself?
* Reform
  * How does reform motivate the development of monasticism?
  * In what way could the medieval universities be seen as caused by repeated calls for clerical reform stretching back to Charlemagne?
  * In what way does Dante call for reform?
  * In what way is Julian suggesting reform?
* Tensions between Church and State
  * Why is the year 800 an important year for the relationship between Church and State?
  * How is this tension illustrated in the Investiture Controversy?
  * In what way does Aquinas’ division between two types of happiness make a contribution to this discussion?
  * How might this lead to two ways of thinking about proper government and the distribution power?
  * How is this tension present in Dante’s Purgatory?
* Self and Other
  * How do we see the concepts of “foreigner” and “other” used in the Middle Ages?
  * In what way does the construction of an “other” serve a political purpose? What examples can you think of?
  * Where especially have we seen this theme in the Crusades, Beowulf, Knight of the Cart.
  * In what way do we see this political construction of the "other" in the treatment of Jewish communities throughout the Middle Ages?
* The Rise of the Crusades
  * What are the factors leading up to the crusades?
  * In what way do some of these factors and conditions lead to the idea of chivalry and courtly love as seen in the Arthurian Romances of Chrétien de Troyes and the Green Knight?
* Faith and Reason
  * How might the author of Beowulf be seen as trying to reconcile Christianity with the pagan Anglo-Saxon past?
  * Why does the rediscovery of Aristotle pose a particular challenge for medieval Christians in the 13th century?
  * How does Aquinas attempt to respond to this challenge?
  * How does Dante invoke Aquinas’s response (synthesis) in his account of Dante’s ascent through purgatory?
* The Problem of Evil
  * What is the problem of evil?
  * What are the common medieval responses to this problem?
    * e.g. Manicheans, Cathars, Augustine, Anselm
  * How does Julian of Norwich respond to the problem?
    * What is the difference between the Juridical Paradigm and her Teleological Paradigm?
    * In what way do these different paradigms lead to different conceptions of God and self?
* The Rise of the Universities
  * What are cathedral schools? Where do they come from?
  * Why do the universities emerge? What does it primarily mean for a university to exist in the 12th century?
* Moral Life and Moral Development
  * What conceptions have we seen of the proper moral life and moral education?
  * What is the viewpoint seen in St. Benedict’s Rule?
  * How do Beowulf and Arthurian Romance literature (Knight of the Cart, Green Knight) promote a particular ethic and vision of the moral life? What kinds of conflicts or tensions are present there?
  * How do we see moral education described in Dante’s Purgatorio?
    * In what way is this vision influenced by Aristotle?
    * Why is the distinction between sin and vice important to Dante?
    * In this context, how does Dante understand the notion of free will and freedom in contrast to rival notions? To what extent is he able to incorporate Augustine's notion of free will into this system?
* History and Fiction
  * This semester, we spent a lot of time with stories from the past.
  * What are some of the different reasons people write fiction?
  * How can fiction be used a historical source? How does it often reveal something about the time in which it is written?

## Reflection

* Reflect a little bit about your overall sense or understanding of the Middle Ages.
* Recall that we started the semester by identifying some common and popular characterizations of the Middle Ages
  * What were some of these surface characterizations?
* How has your understanding of the Middle Ages changed since the beginning of the semester?
  * What are some specific examples or pieces of evidence that support your changed perspective?
