# Introduction 

Welcome to our course, HN202: Medieval World. 

I'm excited to spend the semester with you. 

Let's begin by introducing ourselves. You may already know each other, but I don't know you. So, what follows are few questions to get us started.

**Note**: To answer these questions, highlight the prompt, and then click "annotate". You should see a sidebar panel where you can leave your annotation. Here's an example of what it should look like when you highlight a portion of the text.

# History and the "Middle Ages"

(Note: in what follows there will be some places marked (as "question" or "discussion") where I'm explicitly looking for your input. But a real advantage of our annotation tool is that you can comment or pose questions on any part of the text. So, if there's anything I've said below that raises an idea or question for you, please highlight the relevant text and share your thought with the class via an annotation.)

For our opening class together, I want to begin with some "meta" considerations. Namely, why are we going to study the Middle Ages? Why is this worth our time?

For me this, question is somewhat obviously wrapped up in a larger question. Why do we study history?

If we can answer this question, the relevance and value of the Middle Ages somewhat falls into place. (i.e. if we think the study of history is important, and the Middle Ages is a part of history, then it follows that we should that the Middle Ages must be included in our study of history.)

## Why do we study history?

One way we might approach this question is by first asking to what extent we (in the present) are **always already** using and relying on history in the present (regardless of whether we think the study of history is relevant or not).

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion} 
Can you think of a way your personal identity (your understanding of who you are) depends on your understanding of the past?

{:.rquestion}
Can you think of a way our social identity (e.g. our identify as "students", Baltimoreans, Americans, etc.) depends on your understanding of the past?

</div>

<div class="example" markdown="1">

Let's consider one example. 

Imagine that we all entered our class room together and at the center of the room is an ice cream sundae.

The first questions that would likely arise would not necessarily be about the past, but more likely about the future. We might ask: what do we do with this sundae? Who gets to eat it?

{:.question}
If our direct goal is about the future? Why might questions about the past quickly follow? (Offer your own thoughts before looking at my possible answer.)

<div class="answer">

In deciding who gets the sundae, a natural question is, "how did it get here"? "who made it"? 

If Bob spent all morning making this sundae and brought it to class with him and then Bob stepped out to go to the bathroom, this would likely affect our views about what is right in the future. The past suggest that Bob owns the Sunda because he made the sundae (in the past). Since Bob "owns" it, it seems right that Bob gets to eat it. 

But maybe Bob stole the ice cream from my freezer. How Bob sourced the ice cream would affect our recognition of the validity of is ownership and would thus affect whether Bob alone should get to the eat the ice cream.

And finally, what if no one created the ice cream sundae, but it spontaneously appeared, as if some kind of gratuitous fruit of nature or divine gift? This would once again affect our ideas about what we can or should do with it. If it is a product of nature, then perhaps it belongs to all of us and therefore the ice cream sundae should be shared equally.

For more thinking along these lines consider [Entitlement Theory and Robert Nozick's ideas about "just acquisition"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entitlement_theory) and the extent to which our ideas about what is just and unjust are dependent on our views about history.

</div>

</div>

I hope you can see some reasons why history is already "relevant" whether we choose to study it or not.

But this perhaps raises another question. If we're already using history, why do we need to study it? We use language all the time, that doesn't mean we all need to study linguistics, right?

The way in the which the past is tied up with our present individual and social identities (and critical political concepts like ownerships) suggest that history is politically powerful. Consequently, those in power, those who "own", will always have an interest in controlling how the story of history gets told. 

So, why study history?

To study history is to practice a form of self-determination. If power is always try to influence history, this means power is always actively at work trying to shape your own personal and social identity. 

Studying history is in many ways the critical examination of the "stories" that are already at work. To confirm those histories through your own study is to confirm your own self-identity rather than accept it. To challenge those histories as false or incomplete is to challenge the attempt of those in power to determine or distort your identity in ways that serve their own purposes rather than reflect the truth. 

In my view, to study history is part of an attempt to take seriously the Socratic dictum: "Know thyself" and "the unexamined life is not worth living".

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Let's think about this at a macro level. 

{:.rquestion}
What are some of the common histories that we are told? In what way might these histories be designed by the present to serve or protect the status quo?

Finally, let's turn our attention back to the Middle Ages

{:.question}
Consider some of the present associations you have with the Middle Ages (association that you noted above?) In ways do these ideas about the medieval past confirm or support certain power structures or the social status quo? Can you think of any examples? 

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

One common association I hear is that the Middle Ages is barbaric, dark, ignorant. There is likely some truth to this and there is likely some falsity. But true or not, it certainly reinforces the idea that we, in the present who are no longer living in the Middle Ages, are NOT barbaric, dark, or ignorant. 

Another association I hear is that the Middle Ages is pastoral, chivalrous, idyllic, and in touch with the nature. This reinforces a criticism of the present as "unnatural" (often attributed to the rise of modern technology).

## Periodization and the "Middle Ages"

Hopefully, at this point we might have some ideas about why studying history (which includes studying the Middle Ages) is important.

Thus at this point, we might begin to ask, what are the "Middle Ages" anyway? Why does history include a period known as the "Middle Ages"?

I hope it is clear that the term "Middle Ages" is itself a modern invention. No one living in the time period that we today call the "Middle Ages" would have recognized themselves as living in the Middle Ages. As we discussed above, the designation "Middle" tells us more about the people creating the label than it does about the period itself. To call a prior age "middle" suggest that the person doing the labelling is living at the "end" or "the last" or even the "culmination".

It also suggests a desire to "compartmentalize" history and we should reflect a little bit about this desire.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1"> 

{:.rquestion}
If we take it for granted, that history is worth studying, why is it hard to resists the temptation to divide up history into distinct chunks or periods?

{:.rquestion}
What are some of the pros of periodization?

{:.rquestion}
What are some of the cons of this periodization?

(Offer some of your own thoughts before reading further.)

</div>

Let me offer a few of my own thoughts with respect to the above questions.

First: some pros. 

History is very large. Breaking it into larger chunks allows us to navigate that history without memorizing every detail. 

For example: If I know that an event took place in the American South prior to 1860, I don't have to learn about every individual in order to generally understand the causes of basic events. 

In attempting to understanding why a group of farmers undertook a particular action, I could use what I know about the period to make some probable assumptions. 

What did Farmer Joe think about Lincoln? (He probably didn't like him.)
What religion did Farmer Joe practice? (He probably was a protestant Christian.)
How did Farmer Joe feel about Slavery? (He probably supported it). 

Obviously researching the backstory of every individual in history is not really feasible. But in many cases we can use what know about a period to make a reasonable guess about the beliefs held by individuals and the causes that motivated their actions.

Now, some negatives.

In some ways, all attempts to label something, to name something, both reveal and conceal. 

Certainly, without naming something we can't speak about it. And thus naming and labelling is critical to our ability to speak about something and thus understand it. 

But applying a name also has the effect of concealing. Words often identify something by calling attention to a specific or obvious feature.

For example: the word "ant-eater" identifies a specific animal by its most common source of food. This does a pretty good job of picking out a common point of reference for us all to speak about. 

But the name also conceals. It suggest that ant-eaters only eat ants and it conceals from us other facts about ant-eaters, namely that [they eat other things besides ants](https://what-do-animals-eat.com/anteaters/).

How might the name "Middle Ages" conceal. By calling the Middle Ages "Middle", the label somewhat accurately points us in a particular direction -- that it is a period coming after something (the "classical" period) and a period coming before something (the "modern" period).

But this kind of course labelling begins to suggest to us things that are not always true.

For example, it suggests that there is a clear moment when the classical period ends and the "middle" begins. It suggests that there is a moment when the "middle" ends and "modernity" beings. But of course these boundaries do not exist and our belief in them distorts our ability to understand history accurately. 

It also conceals the many ways in which the Middle Ages could easily be considered the "beginning" or "origin" rather than the Middle. 

As we will see during our Semester together, the Middle Ages could be considered the inventor of the concept of a University, the inventor of "common law", the origin of the English Language, and a new root of communal rather than monarchical forms of government. The list could go on.


# Key takeaways

* History is already relevant whether we recognize it or not.
* The study of history is important for self-determination as opposed to determination by someone else.
* The Middle Ages is a modern construct.
  * This can be helpful.
  * But it also has problems. The student of the Middle Ages must always be attentive to ways the label, "Middle Ages", distorts our attempt to study the very phenomena at which the label points.


# What's Coming Next

* In our next class, we're going to begin to focus on the gradual transition from the classical period to the Middle Ages. 
* To do this, we will use the primary source readings of Augustine as he struggles to reconcile the decline of the Roman Empire with the rise of the Christian religion.
