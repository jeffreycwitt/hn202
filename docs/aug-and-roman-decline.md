# Introduction

Today, we have a two-fold goal. 1) We want to get a general historical overview of what is happening in the Roman Empire in the 4th and 5th centuries. 2) At the same time, we want to see these developments from the specific perspective of someone who lived through these changes. This person was, of course, Augustine. 

Augustine's perspective is important, not only because he is a primary witness, but because he was attempting to explain and provide meaning for the events of the time. Further, Augustine is so influential on the intellectual culture of the soon-to-be Middle Ages, that we need to see how his ideas acted as seeds that would eventually blossom and come to determine much of the medieval European intellectual world-view.

# Some Historical Background 

Using our text, *A Short History of the Middle Ages* (SHMA) by Rosenwein, let's make sure we are all aware of some of the basic historical facts. Consider the following questions.

{:.dquestion}
What was the crises of the third century? (see SHMA, p. 4)

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

This was a time with both external and internal problems. 

External attacks from the north and the east, leading to reforms with long-lasting effects.

It also had internal problems. As Rosenwein notes: 

> "The term 'crises of the third century' refers not only to the wars that the Empire had to fight on its borders, but also to a political succession crises that saw more than twenty men claim...the title of emperor"

</div>

As part of our study history, we constantly want to be asking questions about relations between cause (or cause**s**) and effect. So, in that spirit...

{:.dquestion}
...why does Rosenwein talk about the "Provincialization of the Empire" as coinciding with (or perhaps even resulting from) the "crisis of the third century"? 

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

Rosenwein notes: 

> p. 4: "To contend with attacks, the Romans responded with wide-ranging reforms that brought **new prominence to the provinces**".

Most importantly, attacking groups were actually absorbed into the empire and turned into fighting units. Converted groups were payed in the form of land which strengthened their position within the borders of the empire (but also fostered resentment among older generation Romans)

Further, to support military campaigns, tax money from across the empire was being re-distributed to these provincial regions. (Again, contributing to resentment against the new and wealthy provincial class)

This military strength helps explain the succession crises of the third century, since many of the emperors appearing in the 3rd century were [barracks emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barracks_emperor): emperors that rose through the ranks of the army, won the allegiance of their troops, and used that strength to declare themselves emperor. 
</div>

{:.dquestion}
Who is first credited with bringing this crisis under control? 

{:.answer}
Diocletian (244-311) becomes emperor as another "barracks emperor", rising first as military leader and then taking power by force (as opposed to rising through the aristocratic class). Diocletian is thought to have brought the crisis under control by instituting some important reforms.

{:.dquestion}
What are some of the most important/influential reforms that Diocletian instituted?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

One of his most important reforms, from the standpoint of the Middle Ages, was the development of the [Tetrarchy (293-313)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrarchy) which divided the empire into two halves, and the two halves again, thus into four distinct pieces, each with a different ruler. This reform was meant to help support the governance of the sprawling land mass.

**extra note**

Diocletian also continued and intensified a period of persecution against the rising Christian sect (See SHMA, p. 7).

And it played a role in one of the first schisms between the church, particularly relevant to Augustine's life and work. 

During the persecution, many Christians went underground and hid their faith. Others boldly declared their faith and were routinely martyred. 

At the end of the persecution, those who went underground re-surfaced. Those who had faced the persecution head on, called the Donatists, felt that these previous members were apostate because of their cowardice and should no longer be considered members of the church.

Much of Augustine writing has to do with reconciling the two parties and unifying the factions within the church.

</div>

Important for our story is the history of persecution that Christians endured as a supposed cause of the the 3rd century decline, followed by a surprising reversal leading to the declaration of Christianity as a state religion in 380.

Make yourself familiar with the following timeline.

* 303 [persecutory edict of 303](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletianic_Persecution) 
  * Diocletian (perhaps prodded by Galerius) issues an edit of persecution against Christians (as a scapegoat and cause of 3rd century decline). 
  * This was not the first persecutory edict, but it was particularly fierce.
* 311 [Edict of Serdica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Serdica)
  * Galerius officially rescinds the persecution against the Christians with an edict of toleration.
* 313 [Edict of Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Milan) (See SHMA, p. 8)
  * Constantine re-asserts the toleration of Christians.
  * This is often considered the true end to the persecution of Christians.
* 380 [Edict of Thessalonica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Thessalonica) 
  * Theodosius I declares Christianity to be the state religion (See SHMA, p. 8)

The rising fortune of Christianity in the 4th century is complicated by the fate of the Empire during the same period. After a period of initial stability in the early 4th century, Rome suffered a number of embarrassing setbacks. Notably:

* 378 Emperor Valens and his army were defeated and Valens was killed by Visigoth armies at the Battle of Adrianople.
* 410 Alaric, leading his Visigoth armies, temporarily took control of Rome. While temporary, this victory was at the very least a powerful and potent symbol of Rome's fading power.

Before reading further consider:

{:.dquestion}
Can you think of any reasons why the steady rise in the fortune of Christians in the 4th century and the successful attack of Alaric in 410 poses a problem for Christians living in Rome? 

{:.answer}
On the assumption that divine favor and worldly success/happiness are linked, the setback for Rome suggests that the rise of Christianity has not been a good thing and could even be considered the "cause" of Rome's decline. 

{:.dquestion}
How is this problem motivating Augustine in the *City of God*?

{:.answer}
Augustine is trying to offer a defense of the Christian's against these Roman accusations.

</div>

# The Accusation Against the Christians

The rising fortune of the Christian religion and the ongoing decline in Rome's power lead us to an accusation that is the central focus of our reading. 

The accusation is: the decline of Rome's military might and worldly prosperity go hand in hand with the rise of Christianity and its recognition as a state religion. 

Such an accusation was captured in the common Latin expression:

> "Pluvia defit, causa christiani" / something like: "Rain is lacking, blame the Christians" or ["Drought and Christianity go hand in hand"](https://ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102/npnf102.iv.II_1.3.html)

Augustine's *City of God*, whose full title, is *City of God, against the Pagans*, is therefore a kind of Apology (or "Defense"). It was begun after the sack of Rome in 410 and it was something he worked on for much of the rest of his life. 

Our reading today is from chapter 2.

I see this chapter, in general, as a fantastic encapsulation of Augustine's answer (or better, answer**s**) to these charges. 

Reading through Augustine’s response in this chapter can be a bit confusing or a feel a bit chaotic. Augustine writes in a literary, rhetorical, and meandering style. He is often sarcastic or asks rhetorical questions. 

So, we need to go slowly and try to dis-entangle and then reconstruct the separate arguments he introduces. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1"> 
Before reading further, stop, consider, and annotate: 

{:.rquestion} 
Based on your reading, what general strategies of 'defense' do you see at work in his response in chapter 2? 

</div>

# Strategies for Challenging the Roman Narrative 

I want to focus on two strategies that dominate Augustine’s response.

1) First, he can admit the decline, but argue against the correlation with Christianity (cc. 1-17 seem to fit this strategy)

2) Second, he can deny the existence of such a decline at all by denying the assumption that Rome was every doing well.

## 1) Admit Decline, but Deny Correlation (cc. 1-17).

The general tenor of this strategy is that Rome really has declined in terms of its moral integrity and self-discipline, but this happened long before Christianity ascended in Rome. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
What evidence does he offer for this? Can you point us to any key passages or quotations?

</div>

## 2) Argument against decline.

The second strategy is to argue that the perception of a decline is itself an illusion, because the perception of a golden era of "doing well", of "thriving" is also an illusion.

There are two sub-strategies here that I think align with two different eras in Rome’s history that could be seen as "prosperous".

1) the early but pre-christian empire that was famous for being militarily strong and materially prosperous. 

2) and the mythical Roman Republic, famous for its self-discipline and justice.

### First sub-strategy

Let’s start with the first sub-strategy.

The notion that a society is "declining" or "rising" relies on some fundamental assumptions.

{:.question}
What kind of beliefs are already assumed in an assessment about "rise" or "decline"? What beliefs have to be in place before you can decide if something is "rising" or "declining"?

{:.answer}
Fundamentally, it relies on a definition of what it means to be doing well, to be successful, and to be happy, both at an individual and social level. Conversely, it demands an understanding of what it means to be doing poorly. 

Augustine recognizes precisely this: that there must already be an operative concept of what it means "to be doing well". 

Thus his goal is not merely to argue that Christianity is not the cause of the decline, or even directly to argue that there is no decline, but to radically challenge Roman definitions of what it means to be doing well.

Once this definition of the good is altered, he can argue that Rome never really was doing well (even Rome in its most materially prosperous state) and therefore there really has been no decline.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

So, in the argument that Christianity is the cause of decline from the time of the early empire, what kind of metric of the good is generally being used?

{:.rquestion}
Can we find some places where Augustine identifies conceptions of "flourishing" held by the Romans? (Look especially at chapter 20 (pp. 59-60))?

{:.rquestion}
What conception of success/happiness is described in chapter 20?

{:.dquestion}
Is this conception of happiness relatable to any contemporary ways we measure social or national success?

{:.answer}
Some parallels that jump out to me are the way we often measure how well our society is doing by indices like the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) or stock market indices. Here we measure if we are doing well by how much we produce. We don't spend a lot of time asking whether what we are producing is beneficial or contributes to individual well-being.

{:.dquestion}
Why does Augustine reject this vision of success as genuine or true success?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

Augustine clearly sees this as a profligate existence. For him this is an obviously unsustainable and directionless definition of doing well that can never last and will always contain within it the seeds of its own decline. 

In other words, this kind of life is already in decline, its outward form has simply not yet transformed into the horror that it is. 

As a side note: When we read Dante’s purgatory at the end of this semester there is going to be the image of a siren calling Dante away from moral progress up Mount Purgatory. The image is much the same as what we see here: a beautiful mirage calls us in one direction, but when finally possessed, it reveals itself to be a horrible nightmare.
</div>
</div>

### Second sub-strategy

With this first response in mind, an objection is possible which Augustine recognizes at the beginning of chapter 21 (p. 60 and elsewhere in the same chapter).

{:.question}
What is this objection? (see c. 21, (p. 60))

{:.answer}
The objection is something like: the Rome described above is not the true Rome. The true Rome is the Rome of the Republic.

The objection suggests that there was a different Rome in an earlier time: a Rome that would be just as horrified by this indulgent definition of happiness as Augustine is.

This is the Rome of the Republic where virtue and self-restraint ruled, and thus there really has been a decline. And thus, the objector might say, maybe the rise of Christianity still correlates with the loss of civic virtue and social justice.

{:.rquestion}
How can Augustine respond to this?

I think he can respond in a couple of ways.

First, he can repeat his first strategy of acknowledging the decline but can deny the correlation with the rise of Christianity.

> “…what will they make of Cicero’s statement, that even in his time it had become entirely extinct and there remained extant no Roman republic at all.” (Augustine, City of God, II, c. 21 (p. 60))

The fall of the Republic and the rise of empire, after all, occurred well before Christ's birth. 

Second, and more dramatically, Augustine can once again question the truth of this most fundamental founding myth.

Augustine examines Cicero’s own definition of true and flourishing society. (We have to think of Cicero as kind of “founding father” person, similar to George Washington or John Adams.)

Cicero, in the mouth of Scipio, provided a definition of what it meant for a group of people to be a true society or commonwealth. 

{:.question}
What is that definition? (See c. 21 (p. 61))

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

> "'The people' he (Scipio/Cicero) defines as being not every assemblage or mob, but an assemblage associated by a **common acknowledgement of law**, and by a community of interests." (Augustine, City of God, II, c. 21 (p. 61, near the bottom)

> "...neither would the people be any longer a people if it were unjust, since it would no longer answer the definition of a people - 'an assemblage associated by a common acknowledge of law, and by a community of interests'" (Augustine, City of God, II, c. 21 (p. 62)
</div>

Augustine’s strategy is to question whether the “Great roman republic” every really lived up to this definition: 

> "...was it not perhaps even then, to use the casual expression of Cicero, rather a coloured painting than the living reality?" (Augustine, City of God, II, c. 21 (p. 63, near the top))

> "Rome never was a republic, because true justice has never had a place in it."(Augustine, City of God, II, c. 21 (p. 63))

From Augustine's Christian point of view, how could this republic ever be a true city on this definition -- i.e. where a true city is permeated by true virtue -- if it wasn't under the Lordship of Christ. 

But if it was not a true city, why then might it have appeared so virtuous, so peaceful, so well run and organized?

In Chapter 18, the historian Sallust seems to directly contradict Augustine and suggests that the early Roman republic really was a place where "equity and virtue prevailed".

> "He was referring to that period immediately after the expulsion of the kings..." (Augustine, City of God, II, c. 18 (p. 56)).

{:.question}
How does Augustine respond to this?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">
It might be true that they "behaved well". But what was the motivation?

> "...the cause of this was not their love of good order, but their fear lest the peace they had with Carthage might be broken" (Augustine, City of God, II, c. 18 (p. 56)).

> "You see how, even in that brief period after the expulsion of the kings, fear, he acknowledges, was the cause of the interval of equity and good order" (Augustine, City of God, II, c. 18 (p. 57)).

</div>

I think this is something to which we need to play close attention. 

Augustine's point is that vices can manifest themselves in different ways at different periods of time. And some vices can at times restrain others, and create the impression of incredible self-discipline. 

For example, greed or acquisitiveness can, at times, have an amazing socially-harmonious effect. A really greedy person might be extremely self-controlled and temperate in order to maximize their savings. 

Thus, it may be the case that the societies we hail as shining examples of virtue may in fact be simple moments in history in which more socially harmonious vices reigned supreme. 

(Note: This is after all precisely the advice of Adam Smith. Smith’s argument is that self-interest should not be hindered, but rather pursued intelligently. When pursued intelligently, we will recognize that certain kinds of self-control and social harmonious actions, which have the appearance of virtue, are actually very personally advantageous.)

Augustine’s seems to be realizing that it is possible to have a well-ordered and even externally flourishing society that, despite looking virtuous and complete on the outside, is still not the "home" or place of rest that our "hearts long for".

#### Exposing the Roman Myth

At this point, I would like to look closer at the definition of the city that Cicero provides and to which Augustine's responds.

Cicero's definition emerges in a debate with a character named Pilus. 

Pilus says: 

> "A republic cannot be governed without injustice" (Augustine, City of God, II, c. 21 (p. 61)) 

And Cicero (through the voice of Scipio) responds to the contrary, saying: "no in fact there is no city with justice". 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.question}
First off, is there any way we can support the position of Pilus? Why might it be impossible to have a functioning city without injustice. (Offer some of your own examples before considering mine.)

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

**example 1**

What about criminal justice or the prison system? Is it possible to have city without a criminal justice system? 

Maybe in a perfect world, but what about in our world, where crimes are committed, etc.? 

It would seem not. 

But is it possible to have a criminal justice system that never makes a mistake, that never punishes an innocent person? That never causes unnecessary harm or excessive punishment?

Yet, if, out of fear of punishing an innocent person, we are hesitant in our punishment, then we run the risk of not finding justice for genuine victims of injustice or not deterring future crime and thereby not finding justice for future victims. 

**example 2**

Think about it at a more personal, individual level. Martin Luther King, in his letter from Birmingham Jail quotes Aquinas, who states, "an unjust law is not a law". MLK used this quote to justify certain forms of civil disobedience.

This sentiment from MLK squares nicely with view of Cicero. A city is not really a city unless it ruled by justice. Consequently, the false city (or the "unjust law") doesn't have any authority over us. We should do whatever we need to do to reject and oppose the false city ("unjust laws") in order to establish the just city (or the "just laws").

This sounds nice, but is it always so easy?

Henry David Thoreau, for example, refused to pay taxes in protest of the Spanish American war. He saw something unjust and therefore saw the requirement to pay taxes as unjust. He further concluded that the truly just thing to do was to refuse to pay taxes (or reject the false city, or reject the unjust law)

But can an action ever be so pure? Is there a way, his pursuit of justice, could be at the same time perpetuating new injustices? 

What if everyone refused to pay their federal taxes because some of that money was going to something unjust?

</div>

{:.rquestion}
After reading my examples, do any others come to mind? Please share your thoughts with the class.

</div>

In sum, what Augustine is starting to be attentive to, and will become more pronounced in Book 19, is the moral ambiguity that pervades life on earth.

In contrast to the pure just city, which he will call the "City of God", he says we live now on earth, in the "city of men", which, because it is a city of mixed people with all kinds of different goals, desires, and allegiances, will forever be fraught with moral ambiguity. 

Because of this ambiguity, neither the Roman Republic nor a Christian Empire will ever meet Cicero's own definition of a truly just city.

Here's another fabulous quote:

> "But because this man listens, and this man scoffs, and most are enamoured of the blandishments of vice rather than the wholesome severity of virtue, the people of Christ, whatever be their condition...are enjoined to **endure** this earthly republic" (Augustine, City of God, II, c. XX (p. 59))

Augustine (along with Pilus) is putting forward what is sometimes called a ["political realist" position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(international_relations)) (which you might also see in modern theorists like Niccolò Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, or Reinhold Niebuhr), as opposed to a much more classical "political idealist" position that might be seen in Aristotle or Cicero. 

For Augustine, the earthly city is necessarily imperfect, morally ambiguous for both the pagan and the Christian. There is no sense that the city will ever be perfect and no sense that any citizen within that city will ever be perfectly happy. Thus we are there to **endure** it, to travel through it rather than expect to find justice or happiness within it.

We are "pilgrims" or "travelers" all headed in different directions. However, the members of the earthly city find ourselves temporarily on the same path.

And the big open question (to which there will be a variety of competing answers throughout the Middle Ages) is how do our obligations as citizens and neighbors change when we think of ourselves as pilgrims within the earthly city trying to get somewhere else rather than citizens looking to find happiness and justice in this life.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

To close, then let's end with one final reflection that will provide us with an nice transition to our next reading, namely Augustine's famous Book 19 from *The City of God*.

{:.rquestion}
Is this new identity as a "pilgrim-citizen" a positive or negative development or both?

{:.rquestion}
Are there ways the pilgrim status makes one less useful to the city or even a threat? 

{:.rquestion}
Are there ways the pilgrim status "frees" one to be a better citizen or an asset to the city?

{:.rquestion}
How does your status as a pilgrim in Baltimore (someone here for a while, but who probably won't stay forever) affect your relationship the city around you?

# Key takeaways

* Rome is experiencing observable decline in power and success in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th centuries.
* At the same time, Christianity is on the rise in the late 4th and 5th centuries.
* Romans use this history to identify causes that explain the present: Christianity must be to blame
* Augustine attempts to defend Christianity in two ways:
  * First: Admit decline, but deny correlation
  * Second (and more importantly): deny the decline. 
    * This raises a deeper political question. 
      * What makes a city truly good, truly just, and is such a city ever possible in this life?
      * If not what, and we are actually "pilgrims" who are never at home in this life, what should pilgrim life look like? What are our moral and social responsibilities to the earthly city when we are just pilgrims passing through?

# What's Coming Next

* The question raised at the end here will continue in our reading of Book 19. 
  * What is truly just city? 
  * Can it ever it be achieved?
  * How should we organize and arrange our social lives in light of the previous question. If it can be achieved, how should we achieve it? If it can't be achieved, what are we, as "pilgrims", supposed to do?
