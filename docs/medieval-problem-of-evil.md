# Intro

The horror and despair felt by those who lived through the 14th-century black plague is not to be understated. And faced with such horror it is a natural impulse to ask the question "Why". Why was this allowed to happen? What's the point of all this? Why would God allow this? Would a Good God allow this? Is God really good after all?

Today, before looking at two famous responses to the Plague (the treatment of the Jews, and the Self-Flagellants), I want to look at a traditional medieval answer to the "Problem of Evil" and think about that answers translates in the two kind of responses we see. This will set us up for our next class when we look at the writings of Julian of Norwich who offers a very different kind of answer to the problem of evil.

# Medieval Theodicies

## Manicheans and the Cathars

A Theodicy is a "defense" of God given in response to the "Problem of Evil". 

The Problem of Evil is generally formed from three premises.

* God is good 
* God is all powerful 
* Evil exists

The problem states that any two of these premises can be consistently held, but all three cannot be true at the same time.

An early solution was proposed by a group called the Manicheans, made famous by Augustine’s own flirtation with the group and then rejection and opposition. 

Basically, they take evil, pain, and suffering very seriously. 

Evil is here and it is real. 

But this creates a problem?

How could an all-powerful, good God create evil?

To reconcile the presence of evil with their belief in God’s goodness they gave up on the idea of divine omnipotence.

Instead of saying God was omnipotent ("all powerful"), they posited a second divine being, the evil God, who was responsible for creating the evil in the world.

It is important for us to recognize that this position has a staying power in the Middle Ages and a version of it was revived in a 11-14th century movement in Southern Europe by a group known as the [Cathars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism). The Cathars were eventually persecuted by the Church as a heretical sect. But the point is that the Manichean solution to the problem of evil was an attractive worldview.

## Augustine’s Response to the Manicheans

Augustine rejected the view of the Manicheans. He was committed to preserving God's omnipotence, but this meant he had to find another way to deal with the Problem of Evil.

{:.rquestion}
In the short selection assigned from Augustine *Confessions* Book 7, can you get a sense of how he responded? Which of the three premises does he deny?

Here are few helping quotations.

> "Therefore, whatsoever is, is good. Evil, then, the origin of which I had been seeking, has no substance at all; for if it were a substance, it would be good." (Augustine, *Confessions*) <!-- See Baker, p. 65 -->

Here's a similar statement from another important Patristic author who holds the same view:

> So, then, evil has no being nor does it inhere in the things that have being. There is no place for evil as such and its origin is due to a defect rather than to capacity." (Ps-Dionysius)  <!-- (See Baker, p. 65) -->

{:.rquestion}
Can you find any other sentences is the assigned passage from Book 7 that say something similar?

</div>

In sum: The position here is that evil is not a "positive thing" that is created and therefore demands a creator, who would then be responsible for bringing this evil into the world.

On the contrary, "evil" is an "absence of the good", a "privation (or lack) of the good."

# Accounting for the "privation"

But while Augustine may have succeeded in protecting God from being the "creator" of evil, no one can deny that the "privation of the good" still has painful effects. And the question remains: where does this privation come from? why would God allow there to be a privation of the good when he knows that it can cause so much pain?

Here's where we can look at Augustine account of the "Theft of the Pears" in book 2.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
In Augustine's "Theft of the Pears", where does diminishment (privation) of good come from? Who is responsible for it?


As Augustine notes after stealing the pears (after the good was diminished) he did not feel happy or satisfied. Instead he felt miserable (a kind of pain). 

{:.rquestion}
Is this pain a good or bad thing? 
  * If it's a bad thing, then might we have to say once again that God has created evil? 
  * Could it be a good thing? How so? But if it is good, why does it feel so bad?

</div>

We can see the continuation of this kind of thinking in Anselm's 11th century continuation of this Augustinain paradigm in "Parable of the Lord and Servant".

> "Indeed, if the origin of his inability were not in himself, there
might be some excuse for him. But if in this very impotence lies the
fault, as it does not lessen the sin, neither does it excuse him from
paying what is due. Suppose one should assign his slave a certain
piece of work, and should command him not to throw himself into a
ditch, which he points out to him and from which he could not
extricate himself; and suppose that the slave, despising his master’s
command and warning, throws himself into the ditch before pointed
out, so as to be utterly unable to accomplish the work assigned; think
you that his inability will at all excuse him for not doing his appointed
work?" (Cur Deus Homo, 1.24; Works of St. Anselm, tr. by Sidney
Norton Deane, [1903])

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Think about this parable in reverse order. 

{:.rquestion}
Where do find the servant at the end of the story?

{:.rquestion}
What is he "unable" to do?

{:.rquestion}
If we just stumbled upon someone stuck in a ditch without the power to get out, why might we regard that as a "positive evil" and hold God or nature responsible for that evil?

{:.rquestion}
Going further back in the story, why does Anselm think this lack of ability is not a positive evil, but a diminishment of an original good?

{:.rquestion}
Who/What is responsible for this loss of ability?

{:.rquestion}
Even though the servant is now experiencing a lot of pain for his lack of ability, why might the world be a less good, less ordered, less just place without this pain?

</div>

# Augustine, Anselm, and the Juridical Response

The common teaching of Augustine and Anselm offers a fairly straight forward explanation for pain and suffering; this theodicy is sometimes called the "Juridical Paradigm". In this paradigm, pain and suffering are allowed by God because humans have sinned an angered God. God therefore is justified in dolling out a wrathful punishment to correct the wrong. 

Augustine here is a good representative. In his *Unfinished Commentary on Genesis*, he says: 

> "whatever is called evil is either sin or **punishment of sin**"
<!-- (See Baker, p. 67) -->

In this case, evil (the privation of good) and all its painful effects enter the world because God thought it was good for humans to make free choices. Accordingly, it was right/fitting that they should be punished when human being use that free will poorly. There have to be real consequences for our choices to be truly free.

Punishment (most often experienced as pain and sorrow) is a logical consequence of using our free will to diminish the good. Consequently, punishment, far from being evil is a good part of an ordered world. Without it, the world would be un-ordered and less good. 

Thus, you can see why this is called the "Juridical Paradigm". It is characterized by a "looking-back" perspective. It saves God from doing anything evil or bad by "looking back" to the origin or responsible party for sin. It then acknowledges the need for restoration to the world order in the form of retribution for that past action. God’s wrath, anger (or merely the painful logical consequences of putting yourself into a ditch from which you are incapable of getting yourself out) are a good and necessary part of this restoration.
