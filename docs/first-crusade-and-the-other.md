# Review

Let's review our list of possible causes (or catalysts) of the First Crusade

* Military Reform
* Ecclesiastical Reform
* Rise of the Seljuk Turks

Is there yet another possible cause?

* New notions of Non-Christian "Otherness"

Here's what what the introduction to our reader states: 

> "The incursions of the Turks and the growth of mature Jewish communities in western Europe became the focus of yet two other aspects of eleventh-century Christian consciousness: a sharpened awareness of the differences between Christianity and Judaism on the one hand and Christianity and Islam on the other — a new recognition of the "other" as "enemy" – and the legitimacy of the Holy war." (TFC, Peters, p. 13).

In this light consider the question I pose on the [mid-term exam review sheet](midterm-review.html):

> In what ways might the blurring of the boundaries between the sacred and secular in the run up to the First Crusade lead to the development of new and more hostile conception of the "other"?

# Reflecting on Otherness

Let's start with some of our own reflections on "otherness".

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">
{:.rquestion}
What motivates our division of the many worlds we inhabit into groups of "self" and "other"?

## Simone De Beauvoir on "Otherness"

I want to briefly introduce you to one way the 20th century philosopher, Simone de Beauvoir, described “otherness”.

![otherExcerpt]({{site.assets_url}}DeBeauvoirOtherExcerpt.jpg)

In the excerpt above, de Beauvoir, following Hegel, claims that the creation of otherness is **NOT** something that can be avoided.

She writes: 

> "The category of the Other is as primordial as consciousness itself."

What does she mean by this? 

Basically, she is saying that it is impossible to recognize a self without recognizing a non-self/other. They are two sides of the same coin.

Consider the following example: 

Do you see the white triangle contained within in the white box below? (FYI, there really is a triangle there. You can inspect the html source and see it.)

 <svg style="border: 1px solid black; width: 500px; background-color: white;">
		    <polygon points="250,60 100,400 400,400" class="triangle" style="stroke; white; fill: white"/>
		    Sorry, your browser does not support inline SVG.
</svg>

But if it really is there, why can't you see it?

No matter how real the triangle is, if the triangle is positioned on an equally white background, we will never be able to see it. To see it, to recognize it as a "thing" (or in this case a "self"), there must be a contrast. 

Like so: 

<svg style="border: 1px solid black; width: 500px; background-color: black;">
		    <polygon points="250,60 100,400 400,400" class="triangle" style="stroke; white; fill: white"/>
		    Sorry, your browser does not support inline SVG.
</svg>

What I find interesting about this analysis is that she does not see the creation of otherness itself as a problem. The creation of an "other" is unavoidable. 

De Beauvoir goes on: 

> "Thus it is that no group ever sets itself up as the One without at once setting up the Other over against itself."

The problem, then, is our response to this Other. 

One interesting fact to reflect on, which illustrates the power of our response, is the common root for the word “stranger” in our Greco-Latin heritage.

This Greek word, "hostes", is the root of both our words "hostile" and “hospitality” or "host." "Hostes" is a generic word for stranger, but in different contexts it can be used to signify both "guest" or "enemy".

So what does a healthy and unhealthy response look like?

De Beauvoir states that in healthy cases, a "reciprocity" occurs because each party recognizes the "subjectivity" of the Other. ("Subjectivity" could be read here as something like another person's equal desire to create and invest themselves in self-directed action.) When the desires of two subjects clash, normally there is healthy form of negotiation that results in kind of compromise born of mutual respect.

She writes:

> "But the other consciousness, the other ego, sets up a reciprocal claim. The native traveling abroad is shocked to find himself in turn regarded as a "stranger" by the natives of neighboring countries. As a matter of fact, wars, festivals, trading, treaties, and contexts among tribes, nations, and classes tend to deprive the concept Other of its **absolute sense** and to make manifest its **relativity**; willy-nilly, individuals and groups are forced to realize the reciprocity of their relations." (De Beauvoir, Second Sex, Intro, p. xxiii)

In normal cases, through mutual struggle back and forth, a kind of reciprocity or mutual understanding occurs. 

But in her book, which is focused on the relationship between the sexes, she notes that this "reciprocity" between men and women has not occurred and she wonders why?

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
What kinds of things, desires or emotions, push us to resist reciprocity (e.g. to recognize the status of our Other as an independent, creative, and active subject just like ourself)?

{:.rquestion}
What kinds of things, desires or emotions, might push us to embrace this reciprocity? (again, e.g. to recognize the status of our Other as an independent, creative, and active subject just like ourself))

</div>

Similarly, our reading about Christian and Jewish interaction during the First Crusade suggests that this reciprocity between Christian and Jewish communities has not occurred. 

Further, our reading suggests that the form that this historical "objectification" took was changing in large part due to the new Crusading ideology. The reading also shows that that this new form of "objectification" had dramatic effects on how Jewish communities were treated and tolerated within Christian society.


# Constructing the Jewish Other in the Middle Ages

Were there any surprises for you in the first hand accounts of the People's Crusade? Please share these with the class and point us to the relevant passages in the text.

</div>


## Augustine and the protected status of the Medieval Jew

One surprise for me was, in the midst of many stories about Christian aggression and violence toward Jewish communities, the examples of Christian protection of Jewish communities (see for examples TFC, pp. 110, 114, 118ff). This protection is being offered at the same time that we have other Christians calling for the destruction of these same communities.

This raises a genuine puzzle. How can we explain these contradictory Christian attitudes?

This puzzle can be partially explained through an extended argument put forward by Jeremy Cohen in his book titled: *The Living Letters of the Law: Ideas of the Jew in Medieval Christianity*.

![book image](https://images.ucpress.edu/covers/300/9780520218703.jpg)

I'd like to walk you through a few excerpts that help explain the initial protected status that Jewish communities enjoyed within dominant Christian communities and then why that protection was breaking down. 

In his introduction, Cohen writes: 

> "Throughout much of its history, in various manners and to different extents, Christianity has accorded Jews and Judaism a singular place in a properly ordered Christian society." (Cohen, *Living Letters of the Law*, p. 1)

> "...Jews have had distinctive tasks in Christian visions of salvation history. The idea that Christendom needed the Jews to fill these special roles has, in fact, contributed to the survival of the Jewish minority in a Christian world..."

Cohen explains this "special" role with a quotation from Bernard of Clairvaux. 

> "As Bernard of Clairvaux...put it in the twelfth century, 'the Jews are not to be persecuted, killed, or even put to flight...Indeed, the Jews are for us the living letters of Scripture, constantly representing the Lord's passion.' For Bernard, as for many medieval churchmen, the Jews embodied a particular reading of Holy Scripture, one that established the truth of Christianity in its own right and illuminated the contrasting Christian exegesis of the Bible." Cohen, *Living Letters of the Law*, p. 2)

We should note that, while Bernard (who is really following an earlier position of Augustine) commands that Jewish communities be protected, this is not a command that comes from the kind of mutual recognition and reciprocity discussed by de Beauvoir. In many ways, Bernard and Augustine saw Jewish communities living in Christian lands as an important "object", "tool", or "instrument" (not as a genuine "subject"). Jewish communities were for Augustine and Bernard an important object lesson for nearby Christians. They were a living reminder for Christians of the historical pedigree of the Christian faith and the Old Testament prophecies that Christ fulfilled. 

Nevertheless, this "objectification" had a salutatory effect for Jewish communities living in Europe up until around the time of the First Crusade.

But because this protection was based on the **expected** role Jewish communities were to play (rather than on the mutual recognition of their humanity and subjectivity) this protection was fragile. If Jewish communities ever ceased to function in the way Augustine and Bernard expected them to, the argument for their protection would erode. 

And this is precisely what Cohen observes. He writes: 

> "On the other hand, when Christian theologians **awakened** to the disparity between the Jew they had constructed and the real Jew of history, they could construe the latter's failure to serve the purposes alloted him as an abandonment of his Judaism. This, in turn, might render him less suited for the protection granted Jews who did not function "properly" in a Christian society" (Cohen, *Living Letters of the Law*, p. 2).

This awakening that Cohen speaks of -- by which he means a recognition that the Christian-constructed idea of the Jews is not necessarily matching up to what actual Jews believe or do -- is hastened by the events of the First Crusade. 

Cohen writes: 

> "I argue that the broadening cultural horizons of European civilization during the age of the Crusades served gradually to modify the prevailing Christian constructions of the Jew in a variety of ways. Even as the Augustinian doctrine still found ample expression, Christendom's encounter with Islam, its new commitment to rational argument in matters theological, and its initial exposure to talmudic Judaism challenged hitherto prevalent assumptions. The presence of other infidels threatened the singularity of the contemporary Jew in Christian eyes, just as dialectic questioned his rationality and the talmud raised doubts concerning his theological identity." (Cohen, *Living Letters of the Law*, p. 16)

## Transition to the Unprotected Status of the Medieval Jew

With this background in mind, I'd like to look back at our primary source reading. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.dquestion}
In our reading: what kind of evidence can we find for the erosion of the previous identity of the Jewish communities (which required a protected status). Where do we see the emergence of a new view of Jewish identity, one that no longer deserved this protected status. (consider especially TFC, p. 113, 115)

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

Creating the impression of a Jewish Otherness as "generic enemy":

> p. 115: “They took ‘a trampled corpse’ of theirs, that had been buried thirty days previously and carried it through the city saying…

Emphasis on Jews as Christ Killers:

> p. 115: “Behold the time has come to avenge him who was crucified, whom their ancestors slew”

The Legitimacy of forced conversion:

> p. 113: “They took counsel, ordering that either we turn to their abominable faith or they would destroy us…”

</div>

{:.dquestion}
To what extent can we see the Crusade or the Crusading ideology contributing to this shift in status? (Again see for example, TFC, pp. 113-114; see also p. 53 in the introduction). In particular, are there any possible connections between the growing identification of western Europe as an earthly representative of the City of God and the rise of a new conception the Jew as a monstrous or dangerous "Other"?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

Once the "elect" are identifiable in the way they were not for Augustine, and once there is a conception that we are responsible for “creating the City of God”, the conclusion is easily made: the "City of God" cannot contain any non-elect, therefore in order to create the "City of God" on earth, these identifiable Others must be removed.

Consider the following reasoning: 

> "Behold we travel to a distant land to do battle with the kings of that land. ‘We take our souls in our hands’ in order to kill and to subjugate all those kingdoms that do not believe in the Crucified. How much more so [should we kill and subjugate] the Jews, who killed and crucified him." (TFC, p. 113)

We might note this same attitude referenced in the introduction: 

> “The destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem by the mad Caliph al-Hakim in 1009 had triggered Christian accusation that the Jews in the kingdom of France had urged the caliph to this act and led a brief outburst of persecutions at the beginning of the eleventh century.” (TFC, "Introduction", p. 14)

We can also see this in the speeches made by Pope Urban II at Clermont.

> Perhaps at p. 36, "With the end of the world already near..." (TFC, p. 36)

> And against on p. 53, "[the Turks] have laid waste to God’s kingdom..." (TFC, p. 53)

> p. 53, "I...exhort you, heralds of Christ, to persuade all of whatever class, both knights and footman, both rich and poor, in numerous edicts, to strive to help expel the wicked race from our Christian lands..." (TFC, p. 53)

> Again: p. 113: "Behold we travel to a distant land to do battle with the kings of tat land. ‘We take our souls in our hands’ in order to kill and to subjugate all those kingdoms that do not believe in the Crucified. How much more so [should we kill and subjugate] the Jews, who killed and crucified him." (TFC, p. 113)

</div>
</div>

Once again, I would reiterate: the shift we begin to see in the 11th century regarding Jewish identity is not necessarily praise for the earlier attitude created by Augustine and echoed by Bernard. 

The protected status of Jewish communities was based on a need or desire to control the subjectivity of the Jewish people as if they were a certain kind of object. The Jew was assigned a specific role to play in Christian society and was thereby offered protection as long as he or she was perceived to play that role. 

But because Jewish people are not objects, but subjects, they ultimately did not conform to the role they were assigned. And as the illusion dismantled, so too did the protected status that was associated with it. 

In response, a new objectification of the Jewish People replaced the old objectification.

# Fate of the Medieval Jews after the First Crusade

Finally, as an epilogue and in the context of our continued reflection of how history shapes the present, it might be useful to catalogue some of the ways the erosion of Jewish protection in the Middle Ages led to treatment and characterizations that shaped the 20th century and persist today. 

Particularly notable are new church laws promulgated at the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215. 

* Canon 67: Jews may not charge extortionate interest.
* Canon 68: Jews and Muslims shall wear a special dress to enable them to be distinguished from Christians so that no Christian shall come to marry them ignorant of who they are.
* Canon 69: Declares Jews disqualified from holding public offices, incorporating into ecclesiastical law a decree of the Holy Christian Empire.
* Canon 70: Takes measures to prevent converted Jews from returning to their former belief.
(See [https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/basis/lateran4.asp](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/basis/lateran4.asp)

Canon 68 in particular shows a collapsing of Jewish singularity into the more general category of "non-Christian" and "generic enemy". 

The requirement for "special dress" shows a concern about intermingling. It shows a desire to avoid the kind of "mixed" earthly society that Augustine accepts and an equal desire to establish some kind of "pure" Christian society here in the present.

Art history shows us that these statutes had real effects on society. 

The first example below show various ways Jewish people were required to alter their dress in order to mark themselves as Jewish.

![otherExcerpt]({{site.assets_url}}Canon68Example1.jpg)

The second example below shows another identification through the recognizable Jewish Hat.  

![otherExcerpt]({{site.assets_url}}Canon68Example2.jpg)

Besides identifying clothing, racist and unfounded Jewish physiognomic stereotypes have a root in medieval art. For example, Anthony Bale notes: 

> "And in the famous Holkham Bible Picture Book (London, British Library Add. MS 47682) of about 1325, the Jewish face appears in a variety of profile forms, often with a bulbous, bent, or snub nose (as in this example of Jesus debating with the Pharisees and Sadducees). And yet, at the time the Stammheim Missal was produced, it would be hard to prove there was a stable idea or stereotype of the Jewish nose — it would be more accurate to say that the bent or misshapen nose was a sign of sin, violence, and ugliness."

If you're interested in more on this topic, here is a short article by an esteemed scholar, Anthony Bale, published by the Getty Museum titled [Representing and Misrepresenting Jews in Medieval
Culture](https://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/outcasts/downloads/bale_misrepresenting_jews.pdf).

Bale's point here is that at this time there really was no stereotype about a Jewish nose because such a stereotype is in fact a myth. But here we have a clear clue about the origin of this myth. Medieval representations of Jewish people as monstrous or evil leads to an unfounded stereotype about Jewish physiognomic features that persists today.

Finally, back to canon 68, the most obvious modern legacy of these medieval inventions can be seen in the conscious imitation of these medieval precedents in Nazi Germany.

![otherExcerpt]({{site.assets_url}}Canon68Example3-Modern.jpg)

Finally, we should note the ultimate conclusion of the re-interpretation of Jewish identity seen toward the end of the Middle Ages. The logic is fairly straightforward: if they no longer have a role to play in Christian society, then they no longer have a place in the Christian earthly city. 

Thus, by the end of the Middle Ages we see a series of expulsions from so called Christian lands.

* 1290: Expulsion of Jews from England by Edward I
* 1306, 1322, 1394: Expulsion of Jews from France (by King Philip in 1306 and renewed in 1322, and 1394)
* Expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492 (the "Alhambra Decree").

# Key Takeaways

* We discussed the concept of "otherness" as a philosophical and psychological concept and noted how "otherness" by itself cannot explain "hostility".
* This led to questions about contributing factors that lead to different orientations toward "otherness".
* Then we looked closer at how Crusading ideology contributed to a transformation of how Jewish communities were defined as "other" and the effect this identity had on their historical "protected" status.
* Finally, we surveyed some of the after-effects of this transformed status: the loss of this protection and its long echoes into the present day.

# What's Next

* Next, we begin our review for our mid-term exam.
