# Medieval World Midterm Exam Review Sheet

The midterm exam will consist of two sections. The first section will include a mix of multiple choice and short answer questions designed to test your apprehension of the basic events, chronology, people, and ideas that have shaped the early Middles Ages. The second section will include two essay questions, testing your knowledge of the broader developments of the Middle Ages and how those developments compare, contrast, and influence one another. 


# Key Concepts to Review

This list is in no way exhaustive but is an attempt to summarize several main themes we have covered thus far. 

Let's study together. Let use our annotation tool to point places we might help us review or to add links that will help us prepare.

* Key lessons learned from Augustine’s City of God.
* Basic timeline of the fall of Rome and key barbarian conquests.
* St. Benedict and timeline of monastic development.
* The core values of monastic life present in Benedict’s Rule.
* The development of the Byzantine Empire; it's interactions with the Ostragoths, Lombards, Persians, Muslims, and Franks.
* The Byzantine empire and its periods of expansion, retraction, reconstruction, re-expansion.
* The origins of Islam, events of its early political history, and key early conquests.
* The origin of the Sunni-Shiite split and the effects of that split on the development of early medieval Islam.
* The key achievements of the early Caliphs and Umayyad dynasty. 
* The key achievements of the Abbasid dynasty.
* The political and religious needs for the development of the Hadith.
* The origins of Charlemagne and the Carolingian empire.
* The key achievements of Charlemagne.
* The decline of Carolingian Empire.
* The causes and catalysts for the First Crusade.
* The basic timeline of First Crusade and the significance of key events.

What else should we add here? Are there any other big ideas or important event that a full account of the early Middle Ages should include?

# Essay Preparation 

Consider the following questions (and similar kinds of questions) and anticipate how you could develop an organized and insightful response to each.

* Why does history matter? In what ways are we always using history, whether we think we are or not? How does studying history in a way "free us" from the control exercised by unexamined history? What examples from the early Middle Ages could help us illustrate this?
* How do Augustine’s ideas about the City of God and City of Man differ from the ideas of a Christian empire exemplified in the ideology of the First Crusade?
* Why does Augustine’s City of God introduce the idea of a pilgrimage as a unique medieval theme? Name two different ways we see medieval history and culture developing as a consequence of this idea.
* Describe the social and political conditions that were the crucible for the rise of Islam. Why were these conditions favorable for the reception of Muhammad’s message and the eventual rise of Islam as a global religion and world power?
* Why does the Hadith tradition develop? What political challenges were the Abbasid empire facing and how do the hadiths help address these problems?
* How could Benedict, Augustine, and Muhammad be seen as representing spectrum of ways of properly interpreting "pilgrim status" and the appropriate responsibilities of a pilgrim while still on their journey?
* How does Count Baldwin’s actions during the First Crusade illustrate some of the initial conditions that made the crusade possible?
* How do the themes of military reform and ecclesiastical reform work together to become a catalyst for the First Crusade?
* In what ways might the blurring of the boundaries between the sacred and secular in the run up to the first crusade lead to the development of new and more hostile conception of the “other”?

{:.rquestion}
What else should we add here? Can we think of any other essay-style questions that would help us show an understanding of the **causal connections between ideas, events, and people** that helped shaped the story of the early Middle Ages?

## Essay Grading Rubric

A: An A response will provide a comprehensive and logically organized essay that demonstrates a strong understanding of the relationship between positions and ideas, as well as the consequences of those ideas. Additionally, it will show strengths in providing explanatory detail, clarity of thought, and accuracy. It will be well written and free of grammar mistakes that impede communication.

B: A B response will demonstrate a general grasp of the main ideas involved. While showing signs of organization, transitions between sections and causal connections may not be as strong as possible. For the most part it will provide an accurate account, though it may occasionally err. It will generally be well written with few grammar mistakes.

C: A C response will make a gesture in the right direction but will show little sign of organization. It will provide little in the way of explanatory clarification. Accuracy will often be in doubt. Grammatical mistakes will often impede communication.
