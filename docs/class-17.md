# Review: Beowulf and the Movie

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

As you probably noticed, the 2007 Beowulf movie takes several liberties with the original poem. I'd like to reflect on these changes and more importantly why the writers of the screenplay thought they were needed. 

One reason these changes are interesting is that they point us to puzzles or questions in the poem itself. The changes can be seen as an attempt by the screen writers to answer these puzzles. Thus, in recognizing these changes and the problems they aim to address, we can evaluate how well the answers address the underlying puzzle. (This could even be an interesting paper topic!)

{:.rquestion} 
What was one of the most dramatic changes you saw? Why do you think they made this change? Does this change point to an overall interpretation of the film on the part of the movie creators?

{:.rquestion}
In the movie, what did Grendel and the Dragon have in common? Why do you think the movie worked hard to create this connection?

{:.rquestion}
During our class discussion, we discussed the "lack" of a back story for where Grendel comes from and why Grendel attacks Herot? How did the movie attempt to fill this gap? How successful do you think this was?

# Introduction

This week, we're going to focus our attention on the Arthurian legends that arose in the 12th century, especially in Chrétien de Troyes's "Knight of the Cart". 

Our procedure will be similar to last week. Today, I'd like to spend time with some of the historical background and and then point to some major themes we should be on the look out for as we read. Thursday we will dig into the details of the story itself, led by our class discussion leaders.

# Historical Background: The rise of the "Angevin Empire"

{:.rquestion}
Who is Chrétien de Troyes writing this story for? Who gives him the idea and subject matter?

In the prologue of *Knight of the Cart*...

> "...he introduces another important figure in the romance arena: the patron, the first and primary member of his courtly and aristocratic public. The naming of Marie de Champagne as a commissioning patron for the Charrette reminds that not only counts and kings, but ladies, queens, and countesses, play an important role in the reception of romance." (Bruckner, p. 15, “The shape of romance in medieval France,” Cambridge Companion to Medieval Romance (CCMR))

The mention of Marie de Champagne is important for us because it introduces us to the background and setting in which this story originates. 

Marie de Champagne is born in 1152 and dies in 1181 and she is the daughter of her even more famous mother Eleanor of Aquitaine, who in 1168 rules the dukedom of Aquitaine in the name of her second husband, Henry II. 

Eleanor is a powerful and independent women, famous for her willingness to flout convention. Here are a few bullet points about her life.

•	On her father’s death and with no surviving brothers, Eleanor became Duchess of Aquitaine (See SHMA map, p. 218).
•	Her holdings and inheritance were so lucrative that Louis VI ("the Fat") (as her new guardian) made plans to marry her to his son Louis (soon to be Louis VII).
•	Eleanor would have been anywhere between 12 and 15 at the time of this marriage. 
•	The marriage became increasingly rocky. 
•	Eventually, after the birth of two daughters (Marie and Alis) the marriage was annulled, and control of Aquitaine was restored to Eleanor.
•	But her security was precarious; people were trying to kidnap her to claim her holdings. (Apparently you can do that????)
•	Thus, she needed a new husband, and she found one in Henry II of England.

Let's consider then for a moment how we get to Henry II.

We can recall that in 1066, the Anglo-Saxon line of kings ends with the Norman Conquest 1066. 

When William sets himself up as king of England, he connects and complicates the fate of England and the Continent. 

Two of William's sons become king, William II and Henry I. 

Henry I had one son and one daughter. His son died in a ship accident in 1120.

When Henry I died without a clear heir, the Norman line of kings ended and a succession crisis ensued: a crises between his surviving daughter Matilda and his nephew Stephen. (Why the dispute? Matilda is his direct child, but she is a woman; Stephen is a man!)

This led to a civil war period in England known as *the Anarchy*.

It was resolved only by Stephen agreeing that Matilda's son, Henry II, from her husband the Count of Anjou, Geoffrey Plantagenet (plan-taj-enet), would become king.

Through the existing Norman holdings and the alliance with the house of Anjou that Henry II inherited plus the acquisitions made through his marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine, Henry II amassed control of huge parts of the Continent to point that historians refer this period as the **Angevin Empire**.

I wanted to review this because in recognizing this geographical growth, I want to quickly recall the contrast Rosenwein makes between changes in Europe and Byzantium in the 12th century. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Take a look at Rosenwein, SHMA, p. 214 and then consider: 

{:.rquestion}
How is the West becoming more like the earlier East and the East more like the earlier West. 

{:.dquestion}
What kinds of changes was Henry II making to deal with his growing empire? 

{:.answer}
Creating a larger and more sophisticated bureaucracy and administrative apparatus. 

</div>

This is enough for us to see and recognize that the rise and growth of the 12th century royal **court** (and elaborate codes of court conduct) coincides with the rise of **courtly** literature. 

This further helps us understand the audience to which these strange stories were directed. Knowing the audience also helps us think about the stories in new ways. 

Given this courtly audience, we might expect that the stories produced in this context would address different aspects of court life: for example, the tensions or frustrations within court life, its ironies and absurdities, or its desire and fantasies.

# Court Life and Court Entertainment

As noted, Eleanor of Aquitaine's and Marie de Champagne’s lives coincide with the "growth of regional and princely courts: in the 12th century. 

By courts or "curia" we mean the growing bureaucracies around a particular power center that act as magnets drawing other powerful people and their administrative staff. This is sometimes called the 12th century "Managerial revolution" (Kay, "Courts, clerks, and courtly love," p. 85).

The growth of these courts has couple of important effects that would influence the courtly lives of Eleanor and Marie. 

As is typical, when lots of people with a lot of time and money get together, there is growing desire for art and entertainment. (Think of Broadway in New York or the donations to the symphony and opera from wealthy philanthropists). Today we call such people "patrons of the arts."

And of course, patrons interested in supporting the arts look for "clients." In the 12th century France, there was a growing industry of such clients known as the **Troubadours**. 

Troubadours were travelling entertainers that composed poems and songs designed to entertain their audience. Often such songs, as our pop songs are today, were about love. 

For example here's an excerpt from a famous Troubadour, Bernat de Ventadorn (1147-1170), translated from its original early French / Provencal.

**Can vei la luzeta mover**

When I see the lark moving <br/>
His wings with joy toward the light, <br/>
Then forget and let himself fall <br/>
From the sweetness that enters his heart <br/>
O! what great envy I feel <br/>
Toward whomever I see who's glad! <br/>
I wonder why my heart <br/>
Doesn't melt right away from desire.<br/>

Alas! how much I thought I knew <br/>
About love, and how little I know! <br/>
For I can't keep myself from loving <br/>
Her who'll give me nothing in return. <br/>
She's stolen my heart and all of me<br/>
And all herself and all the world:<br/>
And after she robbed me, left me nothing<br/>
Except desire and a longing heart<br/>

(Wilhelm, James J. Lyrics of the Middle Ages: An Anthology. Taylor & Francis, 1990, n. 55, p. 69) [Google Books](https://books.google.com/books?id=rIOUgtk_DJgC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false)

As reflected in Chrétien's own prologue, where he says the subject matter was set by his patron, these poets gave voice to particular themes that reflected the desires, interest, and complexities of life at court. 

Bernard here, who was befriended (patronized) by Eleanor, is no exception.

# The Meaning of Courtly Love

Since the theme of "love" was so prominent in court entertainment, we often use the word "courtly love" to describe this particular theme in medieval literature. 

And given its prominence, it is worth a closer look.

> "The [English] term 'courtly love' was coined in 1883 by Gaston Paris with [particular] reference to Le Chevalier de la Charrete" (Kay, "Courts, clerks, and courtly love," in CCMR p. 81).

In other words, Gaston thought the "knight of the cart" was an ideal expression of "courtly love."

But what was it? Gaston’s characterization is described by Sarah Kay in the following way.

> "For Gaston Paris, it entails furtiveness because of the risk of discovery, especially for the woman; a consequent raising of her prestige vis-à-vis her lover, whom she may treat capriciously; the responding willingness of the man to demonstrate his devotion by deeds of prowess; and adherence to a code of manners or rules." (Kay, p. 84)

Some of this gamesmanship, whether playful or serious, is visible in the *De Amore*, (sometimes translated as "the Art of Courtly Love") written by Andreas Capellanus.

{:.rquestion}
What does this list of rules tell us about ideas of "love" at court?

{:.rquestion}
What kinds of tensions or frustrations does it reveal?

{:.rquestion}
Does it tell us anything about the presence or absence of love in marriage? How does this differ from contemporary ideas of marriage?

</div>

Certainly Gaston's definition of "courtly love" captures some dimension of what we see in this list of rules from Capellanus.

But is it really sufficient to capture the notion of "courtly love" as it is illustrated in the *Knight of the Cart*. 

Sarah Kay doesn't think so, evidenced by the fact that historically few scholars have been satisfied with this definition and scholarly literature has been obsessed with offering rival definitions. 

For example, we could ask: How does Gaston's definition help us make sense of the ways the story sometimes seems to criticize Lancelot rather than praise him? What does the story leave us ambiguous about the Queen's behavior and conduct?

Kay's attempt to capture the nature of "courtly love" -- or better "courtly love" as it appears in the "Knight of the Cart" -- begins at a very concrete level, by focusing on the link between "court" and "love".

She writes: 

> "Courtly love emphasizes a link between love, in social setting (the court), and its ways (courtliness)" (Kay, p. 84)

Thus, we would expect that the *Knight of the Cart* and the representation of "courtly love" represented in this story to tell us something about life at court.

So in what way do we see the element of "court" permeating Chrétien depiction of love in "Knight of the Cart"?

Kay offers an interesting suggestion:

> "Chretien himself explores various ways of negotiating the **pressures** of medieval court life. His Lancelot is the most famous, but by no means definitive, outcome of these explorations" (Kay, p. 81).

> "In my view, the reason why courtly love is so elusive of definition is precisely that courtly representations of love are built upon **internal tensions**, while also seeking to mask them." (Kay, p. 85)

The idea here is that perhaps Chrétien de Troyes' aim in *Knight of the Cart* is not to provide a simply morality tale of how a good chivalric knight (or a good queen) should live, act, and love contrasted against a bad knight (or a bad queen). 

Instead, it may be a story attempting to illustrate the moral ambiguity of life at court, and the **impossibility of fulfilling one's obligations when those obligations themselves are in fundamental conflict.**

# Possible Sources of Tension at Court

In light of Sarah Kay's thesis, I’d like to briefly mention some of the developments of court life in the 12th century that could lead to a series of tensions and contradictions: tensions that  women like Eleanor and Marie would be living through and forced to navigate on a daily basis.

The are at least three developments influencing court life in the 12th century that contribute to unique tensions.

## Growth of administrative clerics and increased presence of clerics at court

Kay writes: 

> "the early twelfth century saw what has been described a "managerial revolution" whereby the administration of aristocratic households (the basis of the "court") grew enormously more complex"
(Kay, p. 85).

This led to two social groups working in extremely close proximity. 

Lay aristocrats (and accompanying entourages)

And 

Clerical administrators (from which we get the word "clerks")

Kay writes: 

> "Court clerks promoted literacy and learning in lay princes, whilst themselves serving as courtiers of their masters. Under the influence of such clerks, the aristocracy became progressively more 'clericalized,' whilst the clerks, conversely, became increasingly engaged in lay interest. Yet there were also ample reasons for tension between the two groups, who belonged, in medieval social thinking, to two separate "orders", each with its characteristic training, dress, and expectations, dependently legally on separate jurisdictions..." (Sarah Kay, p. 86)

What it would like to be surrounded by Clerks is something hard for a 21st century person to image. We hear the word "clergy" and we are likely to think of a celibate priest.

But this was not really the case in the Middle Ages.

W. L. Warren (in his book *Henry II*, 1977, p. 460) suggests that 1 in 6 people were member of the ecclesiastical "estate" or members of the clergy, and most of these were NOT priests or bishops. 

What were they?

Beyond the traditional role of the **priest/bishop**, there were **deacons** and **subdeacons**, these in themselves were considered Holy Orders. But most people who were considered members of the clergy would not even attain to this status. 

Beyond these Major or Holy orders, there were several lower levels called "Minor Orders", which included the **Porter, Reader, Exorcist, and Acolyte.**

(Note: Today minor orders have been removed, and major orders have been changed to Bishop, Priest, and Deacon. Thus instead of the original 7, there are only 3.)

As the church of the 11th and 12th century insisted on greater and greater separation of the clergy from the laity, supported by increasing legal clarity with the development of canon law, the church was in theory claiming complete jurisdiction over all members of the clergy from the lowest to the highest order. So at court, we would have a huge number people (clerks) socially interacting with another group, while existing under completely separate legal jurisdictions.

Despite the insistence on separation at the level of theory and canon law, Warren is also at pains to show that "on the ground" this separation was often barely visible.

Warren (p. 460) explains:

* most of the clergy were not priests
* many joined the clergy to get an education and used that education in the service of lay master who needed educated people in their administration. (The king employed many such clerks)
* many of those in minor orders were married

Accordingly, despite belong to separate jurisdictions (with separate codes of conducts and expectations) many of these people had the same aspirations: to find love, to have a family, and to find professional success.

In such a setting one can imagine a unique melding (rather than a rigid separation) of sacred and secular interests. Such a melding would include feelings of responsibility to differing codes of conduct (e.g. to one's dynasty or to the church) while at the same time shared and competing feelings of love and eros.

## Changing views about marriage

Another interesting development is the changing view regarding marriage. There at least three important perspectives here.

First, there is the old and persistent view of marriage as a political institution designed to build dynasty and ensure political stability.

Second, in 1184 at the Council of Verona we have the "first official declaration that marriage is a sacrament" (see [Wikipedia, Synod of Verona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synod_of_Verona)).

In short this means, we have increased sacramentalization (or spiritualization) of marriage or the claim that marriage falls under the jurisdiction and regulation of the church (defined by the emerging precepts of canon law). On this view, marriage is no longer just an earthly or political transaction, it has "eternal consequences" of some kind or another.

Third, the growth of the court brought in new types of people with very different concerns. In particular, we can notice the new presence of a merchant class and the bourgeois attitude toward marriage which was quite different from the Aristocratic and Ecclesiastical views.

Aldo Scaglione explains:  

> "The rise of the merchants also had an impact on life at court when merchants began to compete with noble courtiers for administrative positions. The intrusion of this alien social element into the ministerial ranks introduced new ethical factors which were at variance with the mental attitudes of clergy and warriors. This bourgeois invasion was to have a significant impact on the relationship between the sexes. In the mid-twelfth century, at the same time that matrimony became a sacrament, the mercantile view of marriage as a contract freely entered upon by mutual consent, like a mercantile contract, started to infiltrate and eventually, though slowly, to overrun the heroic view of marriage as possession of the woman by right of conquest." (Knights at Court: Courtliness, Chivalry & Courtesy from Ottonian Germany to the Italian Renaissance, 1991, p. 21:)

Members of the merchant class would have had much more freedom in choosing whom to marry. By coming into closer contact with the court, this freedom would have been seen by aristocrats and clergy and would likely have been a source of envy or at least tension.

## Changing views about Knights and Knightly Conduct

Third, we can also point to the post-crusading shift of military energy from a code of military conduct to a code of courtly love and court behavior.

Again Aldo Scaglione writes:

> "Courtesy was born at court, first perhaps among clerical chaplains, then among the lesser nobility. The fact that courtly literature was born in southern France is related to the crucial function of princely courts in that area. **The weakened central authority in the wake of the dissolution of the dissolution of monarchic power in France after Charlemagne’s immediate successors made the feudal lords effective centers of regional power, but the weakness of central government was also reflected in the heightened independence of the lower vassals.** Even such great counts as those of Poitiers and Toulouse had great difficulties in restraining their vassals. Hence the comital courts had to be turned into attractive centers of noble living so that counts could cultivate the loyalty of their vassals by keeping them at close quarters." (Aldo Scaglione, p. 25-26).

This suggests there was a political need to include knights in the lower ranks of "Nobility". Granting knights the privilege of nobility helped secure their loyalty. But entrance into the nobility class came with new social expectations. 

Scaglione goes on:

> "The Pax Dei bears the seeds of chivalry, since the knightly class responded to the complex situation created by the Peace of God." (Aldo, p. 26)

> "The active alliance between the religious and secular knighthood exhausted itself when the crusading spirit failed. Hence the Church’s rejection of warlike attitudes forced a new justification of chivalry, with a displacement of values that could take one of two directions: 1) a willful acceptance of military action (even outright brigandage) for economic and political reasons of a purely secular nature, or 2) a shift in emphasis from the military aspect of chivalry to the non-military, that is, **to a noble code of loving** (the ideology of courtly love) and **behaving** at court." (Aldo, p. 27)

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.dquestion}
Given this background, what kinds of pressures, inner conflicts, interests do think could be found among the readers of courtly literature? (Be imaginative. Try to put yourself into the shoes of these people. What kinds of feelings and emotions might you experience?)

<div class="answer" markdown="1">
Some possible tensions might include.

* Boredom, fantasy, economical marriages
* Concern for order, for dynasty, for lineage.
* Desire for religious approval, desire for salvation
* Desire for meaningful love

{:.rquestion}
Why was marital fidelity on the part of women more highly valued than it was for men? Might this have created a unique tension for women at court?

{:.rquestion}
However far you are in your reading of *Knight of the Cart*, do you see any examples of court tension, frustration, or contradiction in the text? Can you point us to any passages that suggest this?

# Key Takeaways

* Today, we focused on the growth of the administrative court (and accompanying court life) in the 12th century.
* The growth of these courts gave rise to new forms of entertainment (e.g. Troubadours and stories) designed to entertain its court audience.
* The growth of these courts also brought distinct social groups into close contact, Aristocrats, lay attendants, clerical managers, and merchants. 
* In close contact, each social group would have seen both the unique privileges and unique freedoms that each class enjoyed. 
* This mingling created "court tensions and frustrations" that likely would have been exploited by artists trying to connect with the feelings and emotions of their audience.
* Sarah Kay suggested that recognizing such tensions is a key to understanding the depiction of "courtly love" as seen in Chrétien de Troyes' *Knight of the Cart*.

# What's Next

* Next we're going to use the class discussion notes generated by members of our class to look closer at the story of *Knight of Cart*. 
* Among other things, we would like to test Sarah Kay's thesis and consider to what extent keeping in mind court tensions helps us to better understand the story and its unique appeal.
