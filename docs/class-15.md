# Discussion Questions

## Discussion 1

I'd like to start with general questions related to history and fiction.

As the second half of our semester unfolds, we're going to read a lot of medieval "fiction", so it is worth pausing to consider how we should engage with fiction generally as historical source.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
Why do you think people write fiction? 

{:.rquestion}
Can we make a list of the diverse goals of the genre?

{:.rquestion}
Can you think of your favorite examples of pieces of fiction that pursue these different goals?
  
{:.rquestion}
What kind of fiction, or what kind of goal, do you think Julie Otsuka had in mind when she wrote *When the Emperor was Divine*?

</div>


## Discussion 2

While this text may be many things, one genre it seems to clearly belong to is that of "historical fiction". This is an interesting genre in that (in some ways) it seems to share the goals of other works of history, but it departs by creating fictional figures and fictional events in a real past. (Our reading of *Beowulf* next week will share some similarities in this respect).

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
Generally, why do you think people write historical fiction? 

{:.rquestion}
Certainly history is filled with lots of real events with real people, so why not simply tell one of these stories? Why make up entirely new stories? 

{:.rquestion}
Can you think of other examples of historical fiction to support your ideas?

{:.rquestion}
Why do you think Otsuka has chosen to tell history this way? 

{:.rquestion}
What does the genre allow her to do that a simple history book does not?

</div>

## Discussion 3

Seeing this text as a form of "history telling" invites us to reflect again on some of our previous discussions about the uses and abuses of history. As we've discussed, the histories we tell are tied up with our desire to 1) explain the present and 2) justify or recommend future action.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

While this text is about events taking place in the 1940's it was published in 2002, so...

{:.rquestion}
What does this story tell us about 2002? 

{:.rquestion}
How do the events chosen, the characters described, or the style of story reveal something about 2002? 

{:.rquestion}
How does the story (its subject and style) tell us something about a culture's desire for self-understanding or its hopes for the future beyond 2002?

</div>

## Discussion 4

Let's turn to the text more closely. 

Here are a few question that jump out to me, and then I will ask you to bring some of your own questions to class.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Reviewers frequently point out the unique decision to not give any of the characters names.

{:.rquestion}
Why do you think the author decided not to give any names to her characters?

Conversely, despite the general way she refers to her characters, the chapters are filled with precise details that border on the mundane and banal.

{:.rquestion}
Why do you think the author chose to focus so closely on the "little things" throughout the story?  

{:.rquestion}
Is this at odds with the "extra-ordinary events" taking place in the story? 

{:.rquestion}
In other words, why focus on these little details when it seems like so many bigger more important things are happening?

{:.rquestion}
Can you identify one or two of your favorite "vignettes" in the story? 

{:.rquestion}
Why did you find these little details particularly important or meaningful. (Come to class ready to share).

</div>

## Discussion 5

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

The last chapter has a noticeably different voice and character. 

{:.rquestion}
What is different about this chapter? What literary devices does the author use to create this tone shift?

Some reviewers were quite critical of this chapter. The New York Times reviewer Michiko Kakutani referred to it as the "ill conceived final chapter". (See Kakutani, M. (2002, Sep 10). War's outcasts dream of small pleasures: [review]. New York Times)

<!-- Kakutani, M. (2002, Sep 10). War's outcasts dream of small pleasures: [review]. New York Times Retrieved from http://proxy-ln.researchport.umd.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/wars-outcasts-dream-small-pleasures/docview/432195012/se-2 -->

{:.rquestion}
What do think was the goal of this final chapter? 

{:.rquestion}
Do you think this final chapter was successful in achieving its goals? Why or why not?

</div>

## Discussion 6

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
Finally, what else is noteworthy about this book that you think should be discussed?

{:.rquestion}
Did you find something particularly meaningful or powerful? Please share and explain.

{:.rquestion}
Did any particular passage in the book leave you with questions or puzzles? Please share and explain.

</div>

I'm looking forward to our discussion and exploring this text with you throughout the week :)
