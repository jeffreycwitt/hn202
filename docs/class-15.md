# Reminder 

Reminder: Thursday will be our class led discussion of *Beowulf*. The group assigned to *Beowulf* will create the class notes and then help lead the discussion on Thursday. 

For the group composing the class notes, as a rule of thumb, aim to write at least 1,000 words, work to break your notes into at least 5 sections that we can use to structure our discussion (there are are some natural division to the story that we can use to structure our discussion), and make sure to offer 4 or 5 significant discussion blocks/questions.

# Intro

Welcome to our week on Beowulf. I read this book ever year, and every year I come away enjoying the ideas and themes it conveys: both its meditations on life and death, and its mysteries.

While thoroughly enjoying it, I also always come away perplexed. What is the point of this poem? What is its message? Perhaps this ambiguity is part of its charm. But each year new details draw me into different possibilities.

While we will reserve most of our focused class-led discussion of the poem, its plot, and our ideas about its meaning for Thursday's class, today I wanted provide us with some background information and then point to a couple of problems of interest in the poem.

To begin, we can start with a general question.

{:.rquestion}
If the event of this story take place in Denmark and Sweden (Geat), why is this considered part of the canon of English literature?

<!-- While the precise dating of the poem is unknown, it someties u life of Bede (the early English Monk and Historian) or sometime between 672/3 – 26 May 735. -->

While the precise dating of the poem is unknown, our book introduction suggests that it was written in England sometime between the middle of the 7th and the early 10th century (p. xxiii).

{:.rquestion}
But again, why are these people, who live in England, writing about events that took place much earlier and in an entirely different geographic area?

One suggestion is that, like many other epic poems, it could be seen as a commemoration of an ancestral legacy. That it is, it could be part of a present society’s (the Anglo-Saxon society) attempt to define their identity through defining their past.

This is a phenomenon we've discussed in our present society; we've discussed how we use the past to construct our own identities. It is possible, then, to think of *Beowulf* as a historical example of this same phenomenon. The 7th, 8th, 9th, or 10th century present attempting to define itself by telling stories about its past. Thus an interesting question for us is what does the poem tell us about 7th-10th Anglo-Saxons.

# Anglo Saxon History

## Early Anglo-Saxon Period (Development Period) (450-660)

To think along these lines and to read the poem through this lens, we need to look closer at the Anglo-Saxon past.

As discussed before, Anglo-Saxons immigrated to islands now known as the United Kingdom (specifically Scotland and England) as economic migrants in the 5th century.

Here are a couple of common definitions of "Anglo-Saxon" that you might encounter. 

> "The Anglo-Saxon period denotes the period of British history between about 450 and 1066, after their initial settlement, and up until the Norman conquest." (Wikipedia)

> "a member of the Germanic peoples conquering England in the fifth century A.D. and forming the ruling class until the Norman conquest" (Merriam-Webster) 

After immigrating, the Anglo-Saxons quickly become the **ruling elite or aristocracy**, establishing several regional kingdoms ruled by warrior kings. (This elite status is important to note when we return to *Beowulf* and think about the author's intentions.)

As they settled the islands, regional kingdoms founded by warrior elites emerged.

The open lines from *Beowulf* describing Shield Sheafson actually offer us a good example how these warrior-kings emerge.

> "There was Shield Sheafson, scourge of many tribes,<br/>
A wrecker of mead-benches, rampaging among foes.<br/>
This terror of the hall-troops had come far.<br/>
A foundling to start with, he would flourish later on<br/>
As his powers waxed and his worth was proved.<br/>
In the end each clan on the outlying coasts<br/>
Beyond the whale-road had to yield to him<br/>
And begin to pay tribute. That was one good king." (ll. 4-11)

**Conversion to Christianity**

As we will see in *Beowulf*, Christian language is intertwined within the narrator's description of a past pagan culture. This creates a **tension** that prompts many questions about how the author regards the pagan past. Is it a positive celebration or negative critique?

Accordingly, we need to make sure to spend  a little time thinking about the Anglo-Saxons' relationship to Christianity. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Rosenwein provides a few interesting details in SHMA, p. 64-66. Stop for a moment and read pages 64-66 then consider the following questions.

{:.dquestion}
How does Bede tell this story of Christianity in England

{:.answer}
He suggest that before Augustine came to the kingdom of Kent, the population was utterly pagan.

{:.dquestion}
What does Archeology tell us? 

{:.answer}
5th missionaries had already converted large parts of Ireland and Scotland.

{:.dquestion}
According to Rosenwein, what are some of the main differences between the Christianity Bede recognizes and the Christianity that already existed on the islands.

<div class="answer" markdown="1">
What seems most critical here is Rosenwein's note that...

> "...post-Roman Britain's Christianity was decentralized and local" (SHMA, p. 64, bottom)

While Christianity may have been present early on, it was "decentralized and local". It lacked the kind of centralized uniformity of Roman Christianity that one might see on the continent.
</div>
</div>

In the timeline of the "Roman Christianization" of early Anglo-Saxon England a couple of dates stand out. 

565: Columba left Ireland and brought a celtic or Irish form of Christianity to Scotland. Columba founded an important and influential monastery on the Scottish island of Iona. (This part of Christianity's life in the British Isles is almost completely ignored in Bede's account.)

{:.rquestion} 
But this begs a question. How did Christianity get to Ireland in the first place?
 
597: A critical event occurs in 597 (that we've actually already mentioned, albeit very briefly).

Augustine of Canterbury is sent to the Kingdom of Kent by Gregory the Great. This initiates the practice of Benedictine Monasticism in Kent and facilitates the introduction of "Roman" style Christianity.

<!-- “In June 597 Columba died, as a quirk of history at the same time Augustine landed on the Isle of Thanet and proceeded to King Æthelberht's main town of Canterbury. He had been the prior of a monastery in Rome when Pope Gregory the Great chose him in 595 to lead the Gregorian mission to Britain to Christianise the Kingdom of Kent from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism. Kent was probably chosen because Æthelberht had married a Christian princess, Bertha, daughter of Charibert I the King of Paris, who was expected to exert some influence over her husband. Æthelberht was converted to Christianity, churches were established, and wider-scale conversion to Christianity began in the kingdom. Æthelberht's law for Kent, the earliest written code in any Germanic language, instituted a complex system of fines. Kent was rich, with strong trade ties to the continent, and Æthelberht may have instituted royal control over trade. For the first time following the Anglo-Saxon invasion, coins began circulating in Kent during his reign.” (Wikipedia) -->

664: Another important date is the Synod of Whitby in 664 (See SHMA, p. 65).

At this Synod it was decided that the Roman Rite would be observed in Northumbria rather than the Ionian/Celtic Rite (i.e. the liturgy and traditions established by Irish Christianity and St. Columba).

This effectively united Christianity in England with Roman practice.

In many divisions of Anglo-Saxon history, this constitutes the early period of Anglo-Saxon History (Early 410-660 (migration, settlement, and conversion)

## Middle Anglo-Saxon Period (Cultural Flowering) (660-899)

A middle Anglo-Saxon period is often identified around 660-899. 

During this time... 
* one of the first histories of Britain ever written was composed. This is the monumental work by the monk Bede (c. 670-735) (discussed above) titled, *Ecclesiastical History of the English People*. Bede's cultural achievement is a representative example of the "cultural flowering" of this period. 
* Alcuin (a student of one Bede's students) served as an important wise and learned "anglo-saxon" advisor in Charlemagne's Court (9th century).
* And this was also the period in which our Poem *Beowulf* was written. 

This was also a time of consolidation of regional Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms. 

As seen in the map below, by around 650 there were at least 7 regional anglo-saxon kingdoms.

![early map]({{site.assets_url}}AngloSaxonEnglandmapc800AD.gif)

By at least 878, these had consolidated into 3 (Northumbria, Mercia, and Wessex).

![later map map]({{site.assets_url}}1280px-England_878.svg.png)

The above map also reveals the new and defining challenge of this era. It is the same difficulty faced by the Carolingians in the 9th century: Vikings. 

### Alfred the Great (848-899) King of Wessex and King of the Anglo-Saxons

#### Military 

The most famous King during this time was King Alfred the Great. Alfred was considered "Great" partially because he was able to put a stop to these Viking incursions.

Decisive for his ability to control the situation was the Battle of Edington in 878. The result of this battle was a capitulating agreement with the Vikings. The agreement between Alfred the Great and Guthrum included granting the Vikings a settled area within the British Isles (see the map of above) referred to by the Anglo-Saxons as "Danelaw".

His success in dealing with the Vikings was notable and by **886** Alfred was no longer claiming to be King of Wessex, but King of the Anglo-Saxons. (Any traditional list of English Monarchs will usually begin in 886 with Alfred the Great.)

#### Cultural

Alfred was also a little bit like a Charlemagne in England, in that he made a serious attempt to improve learning and "spiritual life" within his kingdom.

Alfred lamented in the preface to his translation of Gregory's Pastoral Care that: 

> "learning had declined so thoroughly in England that there were very few men on this side of the Humber who could understand their divine services in English or even translate a single letter from Latin into English: and I suppose that there were not many beyond the Humber either". (Keynes, Simon; Lapidge, Michael (1983) p. 125. *Alfred the Great, Asser's Life of King Alfred and other contemporary sources*. Harmondsworth, England)

He took efforts to improve the situation by establishing things like a "court school". But unique, relative to the rest of Europe was that school was conducted in English (rather than Latin).
<!-- For example, he established a "court school" and unusually a school in "English"  -->

<!-- 899 coincides with the close of this middle period. (847/849-899) -->

## Late Anglo-Saxon Period (899-1066) 

A final "late" period is often identified as 899-1066.

We can ask two simple questions here: Why 899 as a starting point and why 1066. 

Why 899? This question isn't too hard. It is the death date of Alfred the Great. The Middle Period's achievements were so closely with Alfred's achievements that it has become traditional to mark the end of this period with the date of his death. 

Why 1066? This is also a date we know. This is the year of the Battle of Hastings, when the last Anglo-Saxon King, Harold, was killed by William the Conqueror.

<!-- Renewed viking raids in the late 900s leading to full scaled conquering in 1013-1014 "Swein Forkbeard" and his son Cnut (1015-16) -->

# Thinking about a Literary Problem

With this background in place, I want to start thinking a little bit about *Beowulf* as a source of literary puzzles that deserve resolution. 

We can begin by thinking about this generally in the context of the second paper I'm going to ask you write. 

As I've mentioned before, a good research paper needs to begin from a genuine question or puzzle.

In our last paper, I gave you a problem to start from: namely, there is a museum collection that can only have so many objects, why does this or that object deserve to be in the collection?

But in our second paper, I'm going to ask you to identify a question/problem/puzzle in our reading from...
 
 * Beowulf 
   * (and/or the movie adaptation), 
 * the Knight of the Cart, 
 * the Green Knight 
   * (and/or the movie adaptation)
 * Dante’s Purgatory

and then to argue for a resolution of that problem.

The recognition of problem can often start from noticing things that are interesting, weird, or unexpected. Observing the feeling of: "that doesn't seem quite right" or "I wouldn't have expected that" are good places to start.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">
{:.rquestion}
Wherever you are in your reading of *Beowulf*, what sorts of "interesting", "weird", or "unexpected" things are popping up?

</div>

But the next challenging step is moving from initial confusions to the recognition of a problem (in our case a literary problem) worthy of a written response. In other words: the problem must be significant.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
In the case of literature, how can we show that a question or problem is "significant" and that it needs an answer?

{:.question}
What is common or shared assumption about a piece of literature that two debaters might agree to from the outset?

{:.answer}
Perhaps that a piece of literature is unified, has a consistent message or a point. (There are likely many other assumptions that could be agreed upon at the outset.)

{:.dquestion}
How then could we then use this criterion to recognize and distinguish questions that are significant from those that are mere trivia?

{:.answer}
A significant puzzle might be one that, if left unsolved, threatens one of these goals.

</div>

# A Literary Problem in Beowulf: Beowulf as Christian Reconciliation of Pagan

In what follows, let's practice just a bit and ponder over a potentially significant problem in *Beowulf*.

## A puzzle

In the poem, the narrator clearly has a Christian voice, and in some moments he appears to criticize the Anglo-Saxons past. Most famously: lines 170-180, p. 7.

> "Those were hard times, heart-breaking <br/>
for the prince of the Shieldings; powerful counsellors, <br/>
the highest in the land, would lend advice, <br/>
plotting how best the bold defenders <br/>
might resist and beat off sudden attacks. <br/>
Sometimes at pagan shrines they vowed <br/>
offering to idols, swore oaths <br/>
that the killer of the souls might come to their aid <br/>
and save the people. That was their way, <br/>
their heathenish hope; deep in their hearts <br/>
they remembered hell." 

Yet, at the same time, in most cases, the narrator seems to hold up Beowulf as exemplar and paragon of virtue.

In light of our assumption about internal unity and consistency, we have a bit of a puzzle. Why does the narrator, a Christian, who seems to criticize the pagan past, write a poem which at the same time seems to celebrate a pagan hero.

Anglo-Saxon hostility to the pagan past is not uncommon. As we noted, Bede's *History of England* begins with Augustine's arrival at Canterbury and the conversion of the King of Kent to Christianity. This effectively is an attempt to erase any pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon history. 

This hostile attitude is perhaps most famously represented in a text from Alcuin.

See the short letter from Alcuin in you reader (pp. 91-92):

> "verba Dei legantur in sacerdotali convivio. Ibi decet lectorem audiri, non citharistam; sermones patrum, non carmina gentilium. **Quid Hinieldus cum Christo**?"

> "let the words of God be read in the gatherings of priests. There it is fitting for a reader, not a harp-player, to be heard; the teachings of the Fathers [of the Church], not the songs of the pagans. **What has Ingeld to do with Christ?**" (p. 92)

This is an echo of Tertullian, who much earlier, speaking about classical learning and the biblical revelation asked, what has Athens to do with Jerusalem?

Tertullian was asking about the relevance of Greek philosophy to biblical revelation, and Alcuin is similarly asking what does the pagan Anglo-Saxon past have to do with today's Christian present.

Alcuin's rhetorical question suggests one possible answer: there is no relevance and the pagan past should be forgotten as soon as possible. 

Since outright hostility is common in this period, it is again a puzzle that the attitude of the *Beowulf* narrator is much more ambiguous.

## Thinking through the puzzle

While it may be easy for Alcuin (and even Bede) to dismiss the pagan history of Anglo-Saxon culture, there are reasons to suggest that this absolute dismissal would have been problematic for other Anglo-Saxons, especially **aristocratic Anglo-Saxons**.

Thomas Hill stresses how important historical lineage was for an Anglo-Saxon to establish the "legitimacy" of his power (a theme we’ve seen before) as king or ruler. (See Hill’s description of the problem on p. 197-198.)

Hill writes, p. 198-200:

> "To begin with, the Anglo-Saxons...were deeply conservative and venerated antiquity..." (p. 198)

> "But a secular Anglo-Saxon aristocrat, whose claims to prestige and authority
depended in part on an ancient and therefore necessarily pagan lineage, would be much less inclined to ignore the achievements of his pagan ancestors than a monk cut off from his own family and culture." (p. 199)

> "royal and aristocratic authority...had to have pagan roots..." (p. 200)

Giving that political legitimacy for Anglo-Saxon elites was anchored in the past, Hill describes the tension that arises.

> "a young (or old) aristocrat faced a deep cultural conflict since the dominant authorities in the Church would not, or to put the case more accurately, could not accept the claim that the paganism was a legitimate mode of religion and cultural self understanding. If paganism was legitimate what was the point of Christian faith and Christian ascesis?" (p. 200)

> "The cultural problem of how to reconcile Christian faith with an appreciation for the cultural achievements of the pagan past..." (p. 201)

Given this political reality, some commentators like Hill suggest that it is possible to see this poem as a unique attempt to acknowledge the truth of Christianity and also show Christianity’s harmony or even approval of Anglo-Saxon pagan history.

Here is Hill’s basic argument/thesis for how Beowulf can positively assimilate the pagan past into the Christian present: 

> "...it seems to me that the most consistent way to read the poem as we have it is to
assume that the Beowulf-poet had thought long and hard about the problem and
had arrived at...an essentially “humanistic” reading of his forefathers’ paganism. He
seemed to have believed that the best and greatest of these men knew about God,
creation, and natural moral law, and that when they died their souls went to heaven.
All of these beliefs can be explicitly supported from the text..." (p. 202)

<!-- Video 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C0sFXU0SLo&t=2145s -->

For my part, I wonder if it can be both an attempt to sanction the past -- to acknowledge that the same God was watching over their ancestors -- but also a kind of farewell to an old world. 
 
As I read the final scenes of Beowulf's funeral pyre, I can’t help but imagine a 9th century Christian Anglo-Saxon reading these parting words while simultaneously waiving farewell to a cherished past that must be let go.

It is a bitter-sweet goodbye because he looks back fondly on all the good feelings and associations with the past, but also knows it is time to let them go and look forward toward the future.

This, at least, seems like a reasonable hypothesized answer to the original puzzle. The burden of the argument then would be to use textual evidence to support this idea.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">
However much you've read thus far, can you add to the above discussion?

{:.rquestion}
Are they places in the text that suggest the narrator's ambiguity toward his ancestral past? (Please share quotations and page/line numbers so we can look at these passages ourselves.)

{:.rquestion}
What passages jump out as you as approval and celebration? 

{:.rquestion}
Are there any passages that jump out at you as negative criticism?
</div>

<!-- Hrothgar’s Advice to Beowulf before returning home (p. 46)

> "Don’t forget..."
 
Here perhaps the narrator, through Hrothgar, is trying to say: despite all the effort, the evil comes back.

E.g. the dragon, but also the wars with other nations (see p. 74, l. 3000)

Could Hrothgar be saying: "Don’t confused by your successes; God has his own timeline".

# Key Takeaways

* As part of our set up for understanding *Beowulf*, we reviewed the basic timeline of Anglo-Saxon History.
* We then spent a little time thinking about the general form of a literary "problem" that might motivate an argued response.
* Finally, we started to look at one such puzzle, namely the ambiguous way the poem regards the pagan, non-Christian ancestral past? 
  * We asked questions like: is Beowulf a celebration or criticism of the ancestral past, or is it something in between.

# What's Next

* Next we're going to use the class discussion notes generated by members of our class to look closer at the story of *Beowulf* and consider what other puzzles (and answers) it contains.
