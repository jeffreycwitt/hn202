# Life in early Middles Ages and Monasticism.

## The End of the Roman Empire

Today, we begin by tracing a few of the important historical events leading up to St. Benedict in the 6th century. As we trace these events we want to pay special attention to the way life was changing both in the Eastern and Western parts of the old Roman Empire. 

While 410 is a date we know as important for tracing the decline of the Empire and for understanding what motivates Augustine to write *The City of God*, 476 is often pointed to as better date for identifying the end of the Roman Empire.

{:.question} 
According to Rosenwein what happened in 476 (SHMA, p. 24).

{:.answer}
It was in this year that a Barbarian chieftain, "Odavacer" (sometimes spelled "Odoacer") deposed the child emperor of West, Augustulus.

{:.question}
Why is that such a big deal? After all, it's not the first time this has happened. 

{:.answer}
The reason this is a big deal is what Oadoacer did next.

{:.question}
What would you expect to be the normal thing to do once you depose a sitting emperor?

{:.answer}
You would probably declare yourself emperor.

Instead, Odoacer refuses to claim the title emperor and declares nominal allegiance to the eastern emperor.

Now for the first time, there is no declared emperor of the old Western Empire. Instead we begin to see regional kingdoms emerge -- regional kingdoms that help explain the political fluidity, instability, and fragmentation in the west that further helps explain the next several hundred years.

## The New Kingdoms of Europe

Odavacer is a good example of a larger trend: in 476 he set himself up as, effectively, the first "barbarian" king of the region of Italy. Other leaders would follow suit; various Barbarian tribes were establishing regional kingdoms throughout the remnants of the old Western Empire, effectively initiating the formation -- in an extremely primitive form -- of the ethno-political nation-states that we can still see today shaping the political map of modern Europe.

Let's say a few words about the people groups that the Romans called "Barbarians".

{:.question}
Why do we call them all Barbarians? How much do they have in common?

{:.answer}
In its fundamental Greek meaning, it simply meant non-Greek speaking people. (Sometimes it is suggested that the word comes from what an unknown foreign language looks like, "bar bar bar".)

It more generally comes to mean a non-Greek or non-Roman citizen and anyone who is an outsider. Thus, by referring to the Barbarian Tribes, we are not referring to a monolithic unit. But rather to several different ethnic tribes.

Tribes themselves were a "loose federation" of what might be best described as clans that could be roughly 50 or so families. These tribes have certain kinds of codes of conducts, usually unwritten, and an identifiable leader.

While there are many important tribes, I want to highlight a few groups of particular importance.

**Visagoths**

We are already familiar with one group, responsible for sacking Rome in 410. Visigoths are roughly thought to have originated west of the Black Sea, in modern day Romania.

{:.question}
Why did the Visigoths begin to migrate away from the Black Sea Area? (See SHMA p. 23)

{:.answer}
The Huns invaded the region triggering a mass migration and refugee crises.

Though they sacked Rome in 410, they did not remain there. By the end of the 5th century they had settled in southern Gaul and the Iberian peninsula (modern day Spain)

Make sure to spend a little extra time looking at the maps in SHMA: map 1.5, p. 24 and map 1.6, p. 25.

**Ostragoths**  

Another impressive group was the Ostragoths. 

Ostragoths are an eastern branch, originating from north of the Black Sea. 

{:.question}
Where did the Ostragoths eventually settle and establish a kingdom?

{:.answer}
Modern day Italy and the Balkans.

Important for our present story is that, after migrating from the east, they quickly overtook the Italian Kingdom established by Odavacer.

And in 493, the leader of the Ostragoths, Theodoric the Great, set himself up as the new King of Italy.

**Franks** 

There is another tribe of particular importance. These were the Franks.

Shortly, after Odavacer's success in Italy, a man named Clovis succeeded his father as leader of his Frankish clan.

But Clovis was able to do more than his father. He was the first leader who was successfully able to unite all the Frankish clans under one leader. 

Clovis was born circa 466, succeeded his father in 481, and for a short time he conquered most of the remainder of the old Western Empire (mostly Gaul, aka, mostly modern day France) at the battle of Soissons in 486 against Syagrius, the last Roman military commander of Gaul, who was holding on to small region of land in Northern France.

Perhaps most importantly, Clovis converted to Christianity in 496 and is, for this reason, sometimes compared to Constantine by his contemporary biographers. 

Clovis dies in 511. 

One final note, Clovis is considered the founder of the **Merovingian Dynasty** of the Frankish Kingdom, which we will discuss again when we come back to Charlemagne. But it is something you need to note.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion} 
In looking at the map in SHMA, p. 25, what other migratory groups do you see? Do their names or geographical positions correlate with anything you see on modern maps of Europe (suggestive of a long lasting influence)?

</div>

## Social and Political Changes: West and East

At this point, I would like to pause and consider closely the kinds of social and political changes we see going on in the west that are by a large a direct result of the migrations described above. Then I would like to the compare this list to the contemporaneous developments we see going on in the former eastern half of the Empire.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Review what Rosenwein says in SHMA pp. 24-29 and then consider:

{:.dquestion}
What does former Western Rome look like after 476? Can we summarize the key changes? Use the annotation tool to identify a change that seems significant to you and be sure to tell us why.

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

* Urban populations decline (SHMA, p. 26, last paragraph)
* New localism (SHMA, p. 27), 
* Trade slows (SHMA, p. 27), 
* "Disconnection of rural landscape" (SHMA, p. 27)
* Wealth became based largely on land (p. 27), 
* Sewage system stop working
* Aqueducts ceased; people begin using wells
* Transition back to a primarily agricultural economy
* General illiteracy
* High poverty
* High infant mortality rates
* Frequent arrival of plague
* General loss of traditional unities (empire, province, state, town)
* Western Europe in 6th and 7th centuries was surprisingly empty
* General sense of misery, encourages sense of pilgrim status, and religious hope.
* Disappearance of Middle Class (SHMA, p. 26), leading to cessation of tax revenue for barbarian kings in 7th century, dramatically affecting development in western Europe
</div>

{:.dquestion} 
Compare these changes to how Rosenwein describes the Eastern part of the former Roman Empire (See SHMA, pp. 29-36).

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

* Retrenchment. 
* Urban centers were still thriving, but Eastern concern with the remainder of the former Empire was lacking. 
* After 410, the East did not come to help, but instead began fortified Constantinople with a new wall (SHMA, p. 30)
* Taxes were still collected. 
* Legal codes were developed (Codex Justianianus, 529 and 534; Digest 533).
</div>

</div>

Finally, let's note how the Italian Peninsula is emerging as a kind of bridge or crossroad between these now divided political entities.

* The Ostragoths are eventually battled by the East, using Lombardian (another Barbarian Tribe) soldiers. 
* Lombardian soldiers eventually take over much of Italy for themselves. (See the map on p. 35 of SHMA and the prose description on p. 36).
* At the same time, the east retains control over a small sliver of the region from Ravenna to Rome. 
* Finally, looking at the map in SHMA. p. 25, note the geographical position of Monte Cassino (just south of Rome), where St. Benedict will establish his monastic community around 529.
  
# The Rise of Benedictine Monasticism

In many ways, this historical backdrop helps us to understand, if not the impulse, then the growth and success of medieval monasticism, especially in the west.

One way I think about it is as follows:

Monasticism offered, for those who could submit to it, the opportunity, once again, to participate in a stable institution with structured patterns of life and a division of labor that made the development of culture possible. 

This, in general, is what institutions do. 

Think for a moment about the vast administrative apparatus that makes Loyola possible.

The administration maintains buildings and organizes the distribution of workloads and the distribution of resources. 

But this is only possible through policy or rules. And one must submit to those rules in order to the gain the benefits of the organization. Likewise, these rules require institutions with the power and stability to regularly enforce those rules. 

Traditionally cities and municipalities in urban centers provided this kind of institutional support and enforcement.

But when Western Rome fragments and populations were scattered by war and plague, few urban centers remained to provide this kind of institutional support.

Monasteries became small self-selecting communities where certain forms of life and culture were preserved because of the general submission to the rules of communal life.

Likewise, the Church and Monasteries were creating what I would call *transnational administrative networks and communities* in a time when the statehood and political sovereignty was fluid and weak.

# St. Benedict's Rule

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

We spent a lot of time talking about Augustine's conception of earthly life as a pilgrimage and how a pilgrim should engage with the earthly society. Benedict's Rule certainly suggests that human beings living on earth are "not yet" home. However, he also describes a kind of pilgrim life, that on the surface, looks rather different than what Augustine described.

{:.rquestion}
So, how do you think these two visions compare? Do you think Benedict's ideas about the relationship of the pilgrim to the earthly city are similar to Augustine's or different? In what respect? What textual evidence can you provide for your answer?

<!-- Here are few more precise follow up questions related to our discussion of Augustine.

{:.rquestion}
Is there evidence that Benedict sees life as a pilgrimage; evidence that happiness is not available in this life? Where do we see this

{:.dquestion}
How does Benedict answer the question: If you're a pilgrim, why not just kill yourself?

{:.answer}
> "we must hasten to do now what will profit us forever". (in other words, our job here is to work out our salvation" (BSB, prologue, p. 9) -->

</div>

Benedict himself, seems to recognize that there are different ways to dedicate your life to God, to try "to work out your salvation". And he seems to think that cenobite monks live out this "Pilgrim" life best. He writes:

> "These are the most effective kind of monks" (p. 12)

Part of what distinguishes the cenobites monks is that they live together in a monastery, secluded from the rest of the world. Additionally and importantly, they submit themselves to the authority of the abbot.

So, we should take some time to consider why Benedict thinks this is the most effective way to be a pilgrim. And this question pushes us to the heart of what he thinks we ought to be doing as pilgrims. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.dquestion}
What does he think it means to make progress toward the love of God? What does he think is the biggest problem facing the pilgrim? And how does Benedict's rule (the rules of the monastery and submission to the abbot) help one meet this challenge? (consider especially BSB, cc. 1-7)

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

The biggest problem seems to be pride, and the pilgrim should be striving to break down this pride and adopt an attitude of utter humility.

> "And so, my brothers, if we wish to reach the highest peak of humility and if we wish to attain quickly that heavenly exaltation towards which we climb by means of humility of this life..." (BSB, c. 7, p. 22)

And how is humility cultivated?

> "the first step toward humility is unhesitating obedience" (BSB c. 5).

> "Hate your own will. OBey the abbot's commands in all circumstances..." (BSB, p. 18)

The secluded monastery and the rule of the abbot seems to be the place where he thinks this is best accomplished. 

> "These, then, are the tools [i.e. the humbling commands described above] of the spiritual craft" 

> "The workshop [i.e. the monastery] where we diligently work at all these tasks is the enclosure of the monastery, in the **stability** of the community". (BSB, p. 18)

The mention of "stability" seems important given the political instability that would have been raging through Europe at this time.

</div>

</div>

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

The enclosure and seclusion of the monastery is an important part of the environment that Benedict thinks is necessary for pilgrim to make progress, but it raises other questions about the relation of the monastery itself to the earthly city. 

{:.rquestion}
Is the monastery's seclusion an abandonment of the earthly city or a unique way of participating and contributing to the earthly city? 

{:.rquestion}
Is this seclusion an example of "loving thy neighbor" or is it somehow "abandoning the neighbor"?

</div>

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
Finally, please share one or two of your favorite "rules"? Why did this rule strike you as important, interesting, problematic, or just plain weird?

</div>

# Key Takeaways

* The migratory period that precedes and succeeds the fall of Western Rome is critical for understanding why Rome falls as well as the geo-political and cultural landscape of Western Europe throughout the Middle Ages (and indeed even up to the present day).
* Eastern Rome remains intact to some degree but it is content to let the western half break off. This is the beginning of what we refer to as the Byzantine Empire.
* Benedictine Monasticism begins to rise precisely at a time when Western Europe is looking for stable institutions and communities.
* But joining these communities means submitting oneself to particular vision of pilgrim life. This vision shares some similarities with the outlook of Augustine, but also shares some differences.

# What's Next

* In our next class, we're going to look at the long development of monasticism in the Middle Ages
* As we read: 
  * First, let's consider how monasticism's own interpretation of Pilgrim life is changing as it gets adopted by different people in different places.
  * Second, let's continue to consider monasticism's relationship to the earthly city. In some ways monasticism seems to withdraw itself from the earthly city. But to what extent is this true? To what extent does monasticism rely on or remain in contact with the earthly city? How does this affect its own development and/or help explain the series of "reform" movements that we see in the later Middle Ages?
