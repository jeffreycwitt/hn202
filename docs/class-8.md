# Intro

Today, I first want to begin with some historical background related to the rise and fall of the Umayyad Empire and the subsequent rise of the Abbasid Empire. 

Second, I want to look at some of the unique political challenges that the Abbasid Empire faced and how the development of the Hadith tradition can be seen as a mechanism or tool for addressing these challenges.

# Conquest under Umayyad dynasty

As we have noted already, there were extensive conquests under the Umayyad dynasty. This was a continuation of the conquests initiated by Umar. These conquests extended through North Africa and into the Iberian Peninsula. 

But there are two important defeats that placed a check on this expansion and helped establish the reaches of the empire.

## 717 Failed Siege of Constantinople

In 717, the empire suffered a defeat in their attempted siege of Constantinople. 
Thus, the empire stalled on its north western front. 

## 711 Conquest of Iberia and 732 Battle of Tours

In 711, the empire conquered the Iberian peninsula.

This is particularly important to note because of the eventual trade routes and cultural contact that will result as a consequence of this conquest.

{:.dquestion}
In 711, what people group would the Umayyads have met when crossing from North Africa to the Iberian Peninsula (modern day Spain)?

{:.answer}
The Visigoths

But Umayyad forces did not stop in Iberia, they crossed the Pyrenees and attempted to conquer Gaul or much of modern day France.

### A note on the Battle of Tours and the modern "use" of history.

As the story is typically told, the invading forces suffered a defeat in Tours in 732 at the hands of an army led by a Frankish military leader, Charles Martel (or Charles the Hammer). (Don't forget this name as we are going to come back to this figure). The Umayyads then retreated back behind the mountains, content to control the Iberian Peninsula. 

Given our class's early discussion of the relevance and "uses" of history -- i.e. that the way history gets told often has a lot to do with how we want to understand the present and shape the future -- this is a great place for us to briefly reflect.

You may remember, in 2019 there was a horrific attack on a Mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. 51 people died and 40 we're injured. 

What you may not be aware of is that the perpetrator of this crime, 28 year old Brenton Tarrant, published a "manifesto" prior to his killing spree to explain and justify his action. In the manifesto, which was titled "The Great Replacement", Tarrant attempts to justify his white Supremacist views and Islamophobia through a kind of pseudo-history of white resistance to non-white incursion. In this history, Charles Martel and the Battle of Tours in 732 occupy a central role. Tarrant, it appears, has absorbed this "history" and sees himself standing in a long line of "warriors" stretching back to Charles Martel.

There is growing body of research on Tarrant's use (or *abuse*) of history, but if you're interested in exploring further you might start with [this article by Philip Stenmann Baun](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/17506980211044701).

Baun's abstract reads: 

> "This article investigates far-right conceptions of history and memory through the case of Christchurch
shooter. Scholarly work on far-right memory practices is still in its infancy, and research into the Christchurch shooter in particular has underplayed this crucial aspect of his ideological drive for violence. By investigating the narrative elements of his historiography, **the article argues that far-right extremism taps into a range of historical templates to structure a trajectory of time and historical development that seeks to legitimize present violence in relation to the legacies and exemplary instances of the past as well as historically contingent aspirations for the future**. The danger of this memory working is its utility—through the channels of digital culture and communication—in promising to canonize the terrorist as a historicized object in a chronicle of ancient struggle, providing temporalized purpose to his violence in both a retrospective and prospective manner." (Baun, "Memory and far-right historiography: The case of the Christchurch shooter", *Memory Studies*, 2021, p. 1)

Tarrant's constructed history is no doubt shocking, but it does reflect an internalization of a less extreme tendency to see the Charles Martel and the Umayyad interaction as evidence of an intractable feud between Western Europe and Islam. From Tarrant's perspective, it is evidence of a cultural invasion that can only be met with counter-violence. 

This history is interesting when set aside the work of historians looking closer at these events. Eric Greek, for example, in a 2019 wrote a [thesis](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/42004241) titled "The Myth of Charles Martel: Why the Islamic Caliphate Ceased Military Operations in Western Europe After the Battle of Tours".

In this thesis he attempts to argue: 

> "The Battle of Tours and other victories by Charles Martel are not inconsequential, but it was ultimately the Berber Revolt that shattered the Western Caliphate and left the Franks free to consolidate their hold on Europe." (Greek, p. iii).

The point I glean from Greek's research is simply that Martel's resistance was one of **many** factors leading to the Umayyad withdrawal, but it was by no means the only factor. But why then have western histories fixated exclusively on this battle? Likely because this is a **part** of history that fits well with a larger modern assumption about clashes between "The West" and "Islam". This assumption is something like: these two cultures have always been at war and will always be at war. 

(Given this assumption, we should try to be attentive throughout our study to counter narratives; places where we see peaceful trade and cultural interaction). 

In short, the Martel / Umayyad encounter fits into this story because it reinforces an already constructed world-view. And for someone already predisposed to extremism, such histories do not function as tools of liberation from prejudice, but, in the case of Tarrant, only seem to reinforce it.

# The emergence of Abbasid empire (750-1258)

Let's turn next to the rise of the Abbasid Empire with a quick overview, and then we can connect this directly with our reading of some extracts from the hadith. 

Rosenwein (see esp. SHMA pp. 88-89) gives us a lot of material to help us understand the decline of the Umayyads and their replacement by the Abbasids. Here, in bullet form, I review some of the highlights. (Please annotate and comment on entries that seem to you especially important or would benefit from more class discussion.)

* The Abbasids partnered with disgruntled Shia Muwali (converts) and other holy men ('ulama) who were dissatisfied with the general monarchial decadence of the Umayyad rulers.
* This transition to power originally had Shia support and a Shia inspiration.
* But this alliance was quickly betrayed as the Abbasids gained power.
* Some key achievements of Abbasid Empire include:
  * The capital is moved from Damascus to Baghdad (closer to the old Persian capital).
  * Peter Brown calls this the Persianization of the empire, which includes increased interaction and involvement of non-arab muslims.
  * This shift changes the center of gravity further east and further away from the Mediterranean.
  * As a result the empire became more open to Eastern influence.
* There were no new great conquests under the Abbasid Empire. Instead, they produced an intellectual and cultural golden age.
  * Caliphs funded translations into Arabic of Greek and Persian texts of science, geography, mathematics, philosophy, and medicine.
  * In 830 a library/research institute was established, known in english as the "House of Wisdom". 
  * The "House of Wisdom" was partly established to create translations but also to conduct research.
  * The primary texts of interests were those dealing with Greek science (Greek plays, poems, etc. were not of as much interest) and philosophy. These texts were likely transported to Baghdad from Constantinople for the purposes of making copies and translations.
  * One major project was a translation of Aristotle into Arabic, spawning major commentaries that would dramatically affect the interpretation of Aristotle in the West.
    * Aristotle was particularly interesting because of the comprehensive nature of his work.
    * Aristotle offers a possible total world synthesis.
  * Abbasid cultural achievements also included the sophisticated development of Hadith tradition. An achievement often attributed to the scholar and jurist Al-Shafi'i's (767-820) (who we will discuss below).

# The Hadith Tradition

With this in the background, I'd like to consider some of the political challenges facing the Abbasids and how the Hadith tradition and Al-Shafi'i's work helped to meet these challenges.

## The Problem

During the transition from the Umayyad to the Abbasid Empire the Islamic community was facing a new kind of problem. 

The Umayyads had effectively ruled their new vast empire through adopting and maintaining existing bureaucratic systems and the laws of conquered lands. There is something smart of about this, as it seems the least disruptive way to maintain conquered systems as productive sources of wealth.

See for example Rosenwein's note on p. 126:

> "Damascus was the capital of a flourishing empire, much of which was administered by the Christian clerical class inherited by the Arabs." (SHMA, p. 126).

But there were some problems.

First: The Umayyads gained a lot of wealth from taxing non-muslims, and thus they were quite happy for conquered peoples to remain Christians or Jews. 

But this tax was also burdensome, and understandably lots of people wanted to convert -- these converts are the so called *mawali*. 

Second: The vast size of Umayyad Empire was unsustainable from a military and political point of view. The dream of a single *umma* was proving to be impossible. 

As the Umayyad Empire fell, the Abbasid Empire replaced it and then contracted. This contraction left huge geographic areas with Muslim people. These people lived in different localities under different rulers, with different traditions, customs, and protocols. And as new political questions arose, each locality was developing their own answers.

For both of theses reasons, the question become pressing: 

What makes our society -- now full of Arabs and non Arabs -- Islamic? What makes this ethnically and regionally diverse empire an "umma" or community?

The new task, then, as Ruthven notes, is:

> "[the Abbaids] must find Islamic solutions to the problems the Umayyads had often solved by recourse to Graeco-Roman precedents." (Ruthven, p. 129)

## The Hadith as Resolution

The emergence and organization of the Hadith literature is part of this response, but before we look at it directly, I'd like us to try to imagine the need for it in a more organic way. 

Let's assume the core of Islamic identify is the practice of the 5 pillars of Islam. 

First of all, we might ask why should these fairly religious injunctions have any political consequences at all. 

The 19th century political philosopher John Stuart Mill, for example, identifies two classes of actions, "private actions" and "public actions". 

Private actions are un-regulated and un-legislated because they, by definition, don't cause injury to others. We only need laws and rules about "public actions" because these kinds of actions can injure others. 

On the surface, it seems like the core requirements of Islam (confession, prayer, fasting, etc.) are "private actions" and therefore shouldn't cause political problems or require further political legislation. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

But can we imagine ways that, in a political context, these requirements are raising new kind of questions. 

{:.dquestion}
Consider, for example, questions that might arise about the command for everyone in the community to pray at a specified hour? Think about the command in a modern context, i.e. in your world. What problems might arise if everyone followed such a command leading you to a desire for clarification and nuance? Do you see any examples of these kinds of questions arising in our assigned reading of sample Hadiths?

{:.answer}
What if you were driving at the required time of prayer? Is there an exception? Can I do my prayer later?
What if you were a bus driver driving at the required time?
What if you were an airplane pilot?
What if you were a policeman or guard?

{:.dquestion}
Consider Islam under the Umayyad dynasty, where vasts amount of people remain unconverted. Why might these questions have been less pressing?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

With a large community of non-muslims, society could use existing people and existing local customs to deal with legal questions that the Quran doesn't answer.
   
(An analogous example might be: what side of the road should we drive on? Well the Quran doesn't tell us, but people in this region have always been driving on the right, so let's keep doing that.)

And in our example, we could use local, non-muslim, people to avoid political problems arising from the proscribed Islamic practice.

</div>
</div>

As the number of questions grow, and as the number people convert to Islam, we start to see a diversification of political practices, to the point that idea of a recognizable global Islamic community is threatened. 

At this point, we might object: the original Islamic community at Medina did not have non-Muslims to help plug political holes. Nor was there an existing set of local customs and protocols that could answer political questions that arise for various problems. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
Why didn't the first generation of Muslims need a complex code of written law? 

{:.dquestion} 
If you wanted to know whether you could brush your teeth while you were fasting, why didn't you need to consult a big legal code? Do the example Hadiths from our reading offer any suggestions?

{:.answer}
You could just ask Muhammad yourself.

{:.dquestion}
And why, in many cases, was it unnecessary to even ask the prophet for direct instruction?

{:.answer}
You could just observe what he does. His practice. (The "Sunna" of the Prophet). 

</div>

The need for more detailed guidance on specific issues is the impetus behind the collections that make up the Hadith. The Hadith recorded the practice of the prophet and other Muslims considered holy or exemplary. As such they became a kind of way to consult the prophet or other holy muslims about specific questions even after they had died.

So the Hadiths hold a lot of promise for providing the kind of explicitly Islamic political guidance needed by the Islamic community under the new Abbasid regime. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.dquestion}
But what new kinds of problems might arise through the organic collection of "sunna" by lots of different people in lots of different places?

{:.answer}
Lots of Hadiths means the possibility of conflicting Hadiths. 
</div>

# The Traditionalists, Rationalists, and the Synthesis of Al-Shafi'i

With the need for the Hadith to provide more detailed instruction about how the Islamic community should conduct itself, there began to arise questions about how to authenticate individual Hadiths and discern between conflicting or spurious Hadiths.

Within this context, there seem to be two camps with conflicting ideas of how to proceed.

**Traditionalist** grew fond of Hadiths important to their locality and to holy figures important to their locality. By analogy, we're talking about something like the cult of saints seen in Christianity. 

Usually, the legendary "sunna" of holy Muslims important to a given place were recorded, giving testimony to miraculous events and signs, and these recorded "sunna" in turn helped strengthen the local community and its prestige.

But the **Rationalists** (practitioners of *Kalam*) complained that these legends are contradictory and often anthropomorphize God in ways that go directly against the teaching of the Quran. 

Rationalists therefore advocated for a strict adherence to the Quran alone, which of course leaves us once more with all the political problems discussed above.

Something needed to be done to avoid the problems on both sides. 

At this point we can introduce [Al-Shafi'i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Shafi%27i). Al-Sahfi'i is identified by Ruthven as the third most important Muslim in the history of Islam after Muhammad and Umar. 

Al Shafi'i helps find a middle ground between the Traditionalist and the Rationalists by providing a kind synthesis. As a result, he helps shape the canonical hadith literature that emerges in the 9th century.

How does he provide this synthesis?

**First**, in a nod to the traditionalists, Al-Shafi'i justifies portions of the Hadith literature by asserting that Muhammad is not only the "deliver of the message" but also the "interpreter".

The Quran does not stand alone. In order to be understood it has to be interpreted, and Muhammad is the true interpreter.

{:.dquestion}
(Does this emphasis on the need for interpretation remind you of a Christian thinker that we've discussed?)

{:.answer}
Perhaps Cassiodorus

How can Muhammad function as "interpreter"? Certainly, he could provide explicit instruction, but he could also interpret the Quran through his "practice" (or "Sunna") which was recorded in the Hadith.

**Second**, Al Shafi'i pacifies the rationalists by developing a **method** which could help keep the Hadith literature from expanding out of control and leading to inconsistent and conflicting interpretations (making it unusable for political decision making).

So, with respect to the Hadith, he developed some principles. For example:

He privileged the Prophet's Sunna as necessary Hadiths for interpretation, but he also insisted on a rigorous criticism of the subsequent Hadith literature and he limited the number of Hadiths, and thereby help preserved the Orthodoxy of the Rationalists (See Ruthven, p. 135).

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">
How do we see an example of this emphasis on rigor and method in the Hadith excerpts we read for today? 

{:.rquestion}
Each official hadith is composed of two parts. What are those two parts?

{:.rquestion}
What is the function of the *isnad* and how does it relate to this kind of rigor that Al-Shafi'i hoped to provide?

</div>

In sum, Al-Shafi'i is known for founding the science of "fiqh", which basically means jurisprudence. Most notably he defined the sources that should be used in decision making and the application of Islamic principles in specific and unique cases. 

The "four roots" of *fiqh* (as described by Ruthven, p. 138) are: the Quran, the Prophet's Sunna, consensus of community, and analogical reasoning.

The result of this architecture is know today as *Sharia Law* or the Divine Law of the Islamic community. Al-Shafi'i stands behind it as its chief architect.

<!-- [cut below]

Conclusion: reflections on the proper relation between reason and revelation.

I would like to close by taking step back here and reflecting on the larger and more general philosophical point being illustrated here in the synthesis created by Shafi'i
The question is once again, what is the proper role of human natural reason in the life of a pilgrim?
If the person of faith is a pilgrim, then divine revelation, whether the Bible or the Quran, appears to function as a guide of "travel guide" or "map".
With this analogy several questions comes to mind;
•	Is this map all the pilgrim needs for the journey?
•	How do we read the map?
•	Are there auxiliary helper maps that also need to be considered in order to understand the map.
•	Does reading the map requires special training, knowledge? Does it require special key, or a special lens to be read / interpreted correctly?
•	How does a person get this training? this knowledge, this special lens?
•	In short: How do we know when we've understood the map correctly? What tools are required to do this?
These questions become particularly acute when the map appears to say something that seem to contradict what might otherwise appear to be true.
And this is neither the first time nor the last time we will see this tension emerge.
In fact, we've seen this before. Question Where?

•	Cassiodorus, in addition to requiring the member of his monastery to read of the bible, also required a training regime in the liberals arts, precisely because he thought the bible (or roadmap) required interpretation, and proper interpretation required training.
It's through this lens of interpretation and justification that I would like to try to summarize the possibilities emerging on a kind of continuum.

•	Fideist (Traditionalists)
•	Apologetics, Rational Defense, (Kalam) (strong compatiblism)(Shaifi, somewhere in here)
–	claims of faith are not necessarily discoverable by reason but are rational and can be defended.
–	Revelation and Reason do not contradict the truth, but revelation may reveal when reason cannot understand or grasp.
–	Apparent conflicts can be resolved by reinterpretation of scripture or humbling of reason before truths that lie above reason.
–	Faith and tradition as guiding lights of interpretation, reason is useful to offer support and test against corruptions of this core interpretation, but reason is not necessarily final arbiter of the essential meaning of revelation.
•	Pedagogical Revelation (weak compatibilism) (Philosophers) (Avicenna) (Averroes)
–	Revelation does not tell us anything that we can't in principle know through reason
–	Revelation is therefore given as divine aid or crutch, but not absolutely necessary
–	Reason, when correctly used, is ultimate arbiter of true meaning of Revelation. Anything that conflicts must be re-interpreted.
–	Creates possibility of divide between esoteric and exoteric meanings. Esoteric only discoverable through philosophical activity (mystical activity as possible substitute.)
•	Rationalist (anti-revelation, guidebook is useless, if reason can’t establish it, it shouldn’t be trusted. (see Bernard Williams Quote at beginning of logic texts) -->
