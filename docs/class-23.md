# Green Knight Adaptation

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

If you finished watching *The Green Knight*, consider the following questions

{:.rquestion}
Were there any major alterations or changes in the movie from the text that really stuck out to you? What were they? Why do you think the film made these choices?

{:.rquestion}
Do you think the movie had a clear idea about what the point or essential message of this story was? What do you think that was? How did the movie convey it? Did it differ from the message you took away when just reading the story?

{:.rquestion}
The movie had a few interesting scenes of deforestation and other kinds of environmental destruction going on in the background. Why do you think they added these scenes?

{:.rquestion}
What do you make of the Lady's dialogue about the color green vs the color red? Do you think this was important for understanding the movie's interpretation of this story? How so?

{:.rquestion}
What do you make of Sir Gawain's line upon arriving at the Green Chapel -- "is this all there is" -- and the Green Knight's response -- "What else ought there be"? Are these important clues to understanding the movie's interpretation?

# Intro

Today we want to set ourselves up for our reading of Dante's "Purgatory". 

To do that, we need to say a little bit about the larger structure of the *Divine Comedy* and the place of "Purgatory" within that larger story. 

Then we need to spend time with the philosophical and conceptual background that informs Dante's "Purgatory", both the Christian influences and the Aristotelian influences.

# The Divine Comedy overview (Cantos 1 and 2)

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
How many people have read the *Divine Comedy* before (or parts of it)? What parts have you read? What details or events still stick out to you?

</div>

Read the following after reading Cantos 1 and 2 from the opening of the *Divine Comedy* (posted on Moodle).

In Canto 1 of *Inferno*, it is clear that Dante has lost his way during his earthy pilgrimage. He has fallen away from the straight and narrow and is in danger of losing his salvation.

Dante writes:

> "In the middle of the journey of our life, I came to myself in a dark wood, for the straight way was lost" (1.1-3)

But in his confusion, a guide is sent to him. 

{:.dquestion}
Who is the guide sent to him?

{:.answer}
Virgil

The poem reads:

> "When I was falling down into a low place, before my eyes one had offered himself to me..." (1.61-62)

> "...Thus for your good I think and judge that you shall follow me, and I shall be your guide, and I will lead you from here through an eternal place" (1.112-114).

{:.rquestion}
And this guide declares that he will guide Dante through what?

First Hell...

> "and I will lead you from here through an eternal place where you will hear the desperate shrieks, you will see the ancient suffering spirits, who all cry out at the second death..." (1.113)

then Purgatory...

> "...those who are content in the fire, because they hope to come, whenever it may be, to the blessed people"

then Heaven... 

> "To whom then if you shall wish to rise, there will be a soul more worthy of that than I" (1.121-122)

These three journeys describe the structure of Dante's *Divine Comedy* which is broken up into three parts, "Inferno", "Purgatorio", and "Paradisio", each consisting of 33 cantos. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.dquestion}
Another question we can ask right away is, why Virgil? Why does the author Dante choose Virgil to be the guide for the character Dante? Take a close look at Canto 2, what reasons are offered?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

> "(49) I will tell you why I came...(52) I was among those who are suspended, and a lady called me, so blessed and beautiful that I begged her to command me...(61) my friend, not the friend of fortune, on the deserted shore is so blocked in his journey that he has turned back for fear; and I am afraid that he may be already so lost that I have raised too late to help him, according to what i have heard of him in Heaven. (70) I am Beatrice who cause you to go: I come from the place where I long to return; love has moved me and makes me speak..." (49-70)

</div>

{:.dquestion}
In explaining why he has come, what other character has Dante introduced? Who is this person and what is their relationship to Dante?

{:.answer}
Beatrice

</div>

# Some Exam Review Questions

As it gets later and later in the semester it can be harder and harder to focus on our reading. To assist, I offer some possible exam questions that can help us focus our reading and discussion of Dante's "Purgatory".

* How does Dante (the author) invoke Aquinas’ response (synthesis) in his account of Dante’s (the character) ascent through purgatory?
* How do we see moral education described in Dante’s Purgatory?
* In what way is this vision influenced by Aristotle?
* Why is the distinction between sin and vice important to Dante?
* In this context, how does Dante understand the notion of free will and freedom in contrast to rival notions?

# Purgatory

Why are we focusing on "Purgatory"?

One reason is because "Purgatory" offers us yet another chance to observe the medieval attempt to synthesize its pagan and Christian heritage. Specifically, in "Purgatory" we can see ways that Dante tries to incorporate and reconcile the new teaching of Aristotle with the Christian tradition. 

So, I'd like to spend some time with this, specifically with an overview of Aristotle's basic ethical theory so that we can see how it might be at work in "Purgatory". 

First, note that at the very beginning of their arrival on the island of Purgatory, Virgil instructs Dante to do something. 

Virgil asks Dante to "wash" his face. (Canto 1.94-96, p. 23)

This washing parallels the rite of baptism in earthly life and in both cases they represent the removal of the stain of sin.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
If sin is removed in this moment (for all inhabitants of Purgatory), why might the climb up Mt. Purgatory still be necessary? 

{:.dquestion}
What distinction does the introduction to "Purgatory" make between "sin" and "vice" (p. 8)? How might this explain why the ascent through Purgatory is still necessary?

{:.answer}
Sin is the action performed. Vice points to the habit (or metaphorical scar) left behind. Because the habit or tendency toward sin is created by the frequent repetition of sinful acts in life, it remains even after sin is removed and this habit, tendency, or disposition still needs to be corrected.

</div>

There is, therefore, a nice parallel here (with some differences) between the pilgrim ascending Mt. Purgatory and the earthly pilgrim living their earthly life.

In this life, the Christian also begins in baptism -- with the washing away of original sin -- and then one must go forward to build the habits required for happiness and salvation.

The main difference lies in the fact that, while still on Earth, the choice to "sin" remains within the power of the earthly pilgrim. Thus it is within the power of the pilgrim to build both good habits (virtues) or bad habits (vices). In contrast, the pilgrim in Purgatory can no longer sin and is only in the process of removing the "scars of sin" (vices) and building good habits (i.e. virtues). 

Nevertheless, it is the conception of the moral life as one of **habit building** in both cases that is central. 

This is notable because this focus on ethics as a process of **habit building** is central to Aristotle's *Ethics*. Dante, a little bit like Aquinas, takes this ethical theory and attempts to situate (or "synthesize" it) within a Christian context.

# Aristotle's Ethics

In order to see this, I’d like to overview the essential characteristics of Aristotle's *Ethics*.

Such an overview is not easy to do because we could spend several weeks reading Aristotle’s *Ethics*. For the moment, let me try to break it down into approximately 11 main bullet points. 

(Please use the annotation to tool to highlight steps in this list that are a bit fuzzy and would benefit from more discussion and explanation during our class discussion).

1. "Virtue" just means excellence.
2. There are two ways human beings can be excellent according to the different parts of the soul. 
  * The intellectual part can be excellent (these are called intellectual virtues).
  * The sensitive (desiring) part can be excellent (these are called moral virtues) and they are our focus here.
3.	Moral virtues are defined as a disposition, or state of character, or a "way of having a feeling".
  * In short, you are not praised or blamed because you are angry or have a desire.
  * You are praised or blamed because you were angry or desirous in the wrong amount, at the wrong time, or with respect to the wrong things. 
4.	Strictly speaking, then virtues are not actions, they are settled dispositions (maybe they could be called "attunements"), from which actions flow.
5.	So why are we praised or blamed for these dispositions? Normally, we don’t think that the way in which we feel something is under our control. When something makes you sad or angry, normally you don’t feel like you have any immediate control over this. 
  * Question: In what sense though might we still be responsible for becoming extremely angry about trivial things?
  * Possible answer: we cultivated this disposition for excessive anger over time. 	
  * And this is why moral virtues are described as habits. They are not learned from instruction (because they actually reside in the sensitive part of the soul, not the rational part) and therefore they have to be molded and shaped (like a baseball glove molds to a baseball) over time. 
6.	Habits are formed through the repetition of action over time. We must do/imitate the kinds of actions an already virtuous person would do. Overtime this will create a new disposition that naturally/instinctively tends toward virtuous actions. 
   * Accordingly, the idea of role models, examples, and guides are particularly important here: something we see lots of in Dante's "Purgatory".
7.	Aristotle’s theory of virtues has enormous implications for the way we think about pleasure and the good.
   * Our dispositions determine what is pleasant and what appears to us as "good", what is painful and what appears as "bad".
   * The best way I can explain this is with a metaphor. 
     * The acquisition of virtue or vice is like the acquisition of the taste for a new food (for example, coffee).
     * At first your natural inclination is unfavorable toward coffee and therefore it tastes painful to you and you do not see it as good.
     * But here is the big question. What does that pain mean? Does that mean coffee is not good, but bad? Or does it mean that you are somehow impoverished or corrupted, such that you are not able to see/feel that this good. 
       * Acquiring the taste for the symphony or Shakespeare might be a more relevant example. The first time you read Shakespeare was probably hard and painful, but few of us want to conclude that this this means Shakespeare is trash. 
       * In fact, we endure the pain so that one day we can learn to appreciate it. We pay people a lot of money to teach us how to do it, so that one day reading it is pleasant and easy.
     * Back to coffee. The only way you will acquire a taste for it is by forcing yourself to endure that pain and keep drinking it. 
     * Over time you get used to it until it is not so painful and eventually your natural inclination (attunement/disposition) has been replaced by a new one, such that drinking coffee is now pleasant and appears to you as good. 
8. A critical point here is that, for Aristotle, our moral dispositions determine **how we see the world**. They determine what **appears** to us as good and what **appears** to us bad, what is pleasant and what is painful.
   * Moral dispositions are like **pairs of glasses** through which we interpret the world.
   * We all see good and bad in this life, but the virtuous person is distinguished, according to Aristotle, because what is pleasant for this person and what appears to them **as** good actually **is** good. In contrast, what is pleasant and appears good to the vicious person is not actually good. 
   * We can see this clearly influencing Dante in lines 1-3 of Canto 10.
     * "When we were within the threshold of the gate / in disuse because of human soul’s evil love, which makes the twisted way seem straight"
9. Aristotle’s analysis of decision-making and "FREE" action over instinct depends on this vision.
  * Deliberation, he says, uses this vision to identify what is "good" and worth pursuing and then, on the basis of this vision of the good, deliberation identifies the best course of action (rather than relying on pure instinct).
  * "Freedom" in this sense is not the ability to do anything, but the freedom to pursue the actual good. Only the person who has an accurate perception of the good has this ability/freedom.
  * Once more: the kind of freedom Aristotle recognizes and that Dante will often allude to is a will that "has been freed" (in the sense of, "is now capable of") to choose the good because they now have a clear vision of the truly good.
  * Without an accurate vision of the good, one is in a way "unfree": "unfree" because they lack the knowledge to do what they really want to do.
10.	It is difficult to correct a disposition alone.
   * Finally, let’s end with a difficult question based on the above analysis.
   * Question: If I’m not yet virtuous, but I want to become virtuous, and virtue is acquired through the frequent repetition of right actions, what problem might I face?
   * Answer: If action flows from deliberation based on my impression of what I currently see as pleasant and the good, but my vision of the good is a product of my current disposition, I will always be led to choose the wrong action and never develop a new disposition. Rather I will deepen and reinforce my vicious disposition.
   * Does anyone see a way out?
11.	Society and Laws / Punishment and Reward 
   * For Aristotle, no one (or very few people) can acquire moral virtue by themselves. 
   * Rather, in order to become virtuous we need to practice actions prescribed by other people who are already virtuous. 
   * And we need to perform these actions even though they go against our the inclinations/instincts of our current disposition.
   * But this is precisely what laws do. Laws are the accumulated wisdom of a society, the instructions of how one should act if they want to become a virtuous person. They are the actions that a virtuous person would instinctively do without need of reward or punishment. 
   * But for those of us who are not yet virtuous, following the actions commanded by laws can feel painful. Thus, we are enticed with external rewards to get us to follow these laws and we are threatened with punishment when we do not. 
   * The goal is not that we are motivated by external punishment and reward forever, but that the external motivators get us to do what our current dispositions don't encourage us to do. But over time, our dispositions change, and these actions become what we "naturally" do. 

# Aristotle and the Thomistic Synthesis in Dante

A key tension between Aristotle's *Ethics* and Christianity was Aristotle's suggestion that "natural reason" is sufficient for a person to become happy in this life.

This doesn't seem to square very well with the position of someone like Augustine, who said that "happiness" was not available in this life. 

To see how Dante resolves this tension we need to keep in mind the synthesis provided by Aquinas. Namely, there are two kinds of "happiness" at issue here. Reason is enough to lead us to the first, but insufficient to lead us to the second. 

This reconciliation is consistent with Aquinas's larger view toward natural reason and revelation. There are some truths that are capable of being known through the use of our natural reason; these are the truths necessary to acquire natural virtue, which is needed to acquire natural happiness. And there are some truths required for "supernatural" virtue that natural reason can never give us. The acquisition of these virtues require grace: namely the grace of "revelation". 

Thus we get something like the following: 

* Natural reason --> actions/acquisition --> cardinal virtues (4) --> natural happiness
* Faith --> grace/gift/infusion --> theological virtues (3) --> supernatural happiness

But, as we mentioned before, there is one other reason God give us the grace of revelation. 

Even though the truths required for natural happiness are in principle achievable. They are also HARD to achieve. It takes a tremendous amount of time to achieve them and they are often discovered imperfectly. 

Thus, God in his mercy recognized this weakness and offered them to us through revelation. We should not be surprised, then, that there are some things revealed in the Bible that Aristotle figured out despite not having access to the Bible. 

In sum, there is a double operation of grace. 1) Grace is there to assist us when we stumble in our attempt to do what we are in principle capable of doing and 2) grace is offered to lead us beyond natural happiness to supernatural beatitude. 

With this in mind, as we read Dante's "Purgatory", I would like us to especially look for evidence of this synthesis at work in the story he tells. For example: 

* Where do we see natural reason at work? 
* Where do we see natural reason failing? (Why does it fail, does it fail because it is weak, does it fail because it has reached a limit)?
* Where do we see Aristotle's system of moral formation playing out?
* Where do we see Christian themes adding to this moral psychology and how (as a supplement or as a correction)?
* Finally, how do we see grace illustrated and depicted in this story? In what capacity is grace/revelation functioning as an assistance to the weakness of our natural power or as a supernatural infusion.

# The Rebellious Will

Finally, there is another Christian/Aristotelian tension that we might want to keep an eye out for in the poem that is not so easy to reconcile. 

In Augustine's *Confessions* he describes a "theft of pears" and spends a long time explaining why he stole the pears. 

{:.rquestion}
Does anyone remember this story? Why did Augustine say he stole the pears?

We should contrast this with an idea from Plato and Aristotle visible in the the above account of Aristotle' moral psychology. This is the idea that "no one is voluntarily wicked" or, said differently, "all wickedness is in some way deep down the result of ignorance".

Thus, the ultimate solution to wickedness in the world is "education". Through correcting this ignorance everyone will be able to clearly see what the good is and will be **free** (that is capable) to pursue the true good that is ultimately what they really want. 

But Augustine's "Theft of the Pears" story complicates this idea. It suggests that the will is more **radically free** and operates independently of reason. Accordingly, the story suggests that wickedness can still occur even in someone with a perfectly clear vision of the good. 

So, here are a few further questions about the "will" for us to consider as we read Dante.
  
* To what extent are these competing ideas of the "Will" present in the story? 
* Does Dante prefer one over the other? 
* If they are both present, can they successfully be reconciled?

# Key Takeaways

* Our goal today was to put a lot of background pieces in place for our reading of Dante's "Purgatory".
* We got a sense of the structure of Dante's Poem.
* We looked at the distinction between sin and vice and why Purgatory might still be necessary even when the ability to sin has been removed.
* We saw that the notion of "vice" as a "habit" left by the frequent performance of sin is a pointer to the presence of Aristotle's moral psychology in Dante's poem.
  * Accordingly, we identified some of the essential characteristics of Aristotle's ethical theory so that we can look for evidence of this theory in Dante's "Purgatory".
* Finally, we pointed to some furthers questions to be on the look out, namely: 
  * To what extent does Dante follow Aquinas's synthesis between natural and supernatural happiness, natural reason and revelation?
  * To what extent does Dante reconcile the competing notions of the will seen in Aristotle and Augustine.

# What's Next

* Next time will begin our discussion of Canto's 1-15 led by our class discussion leaders.
