# The Black Death: Basic Details

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

From our reading in Kelly, Rosenwein (esp. SHMA, pp. 308-311), or any information you already know, can we generate a basic description of what the "Black Death" is?

For example: 

* What is it?
* Where did it come from?
* How did it travel?
* What was its effect (it size, scale, etc.)?

</div>

John Kelly, in his first chapter on the Black Death (not in our assigned reading) makes an important observation. He writes: 

> "Y. pestis's natural prey are turbots, marmots, rats, squirrels, gerbils, prairie dogs, and roughly two hundred other rodent species. For the pathogen to ignite a major outbreak of human disease on the scale of the Black Death, a number of extraordinary things had to have happened."

What seems noteworthy here is the fact that the Plague is caused by a naturally occurring bacteria (Y pestis). It has existed in the world for a long time and continues to exist today. And yet, the human world does consistently and perpetually suffer from its deadly infection. Accordingly, its mere presence in the world is not enough to explain the dramatic impact it had on Europe in the 14th century. While the existence of the bacteria is a **necessary cause** of the Black Death, it is not a **sufficient cause**. Other factors must have been involved to lead these dramatic consequences.

Our investigation of these causes gives us a chance to examine not only the Black Death but other important historical developments in the 14th century that helped create the conditions for the Black Death. 

Our reading from Kelly focuses on three such causes.

* Famine
* Hygiene
* War

To this list, we should add: 

* trade and increased globalization

Let's explore each in a bit more depth. 

# Trade and increased globalization

Let's begin with "trade and increased globalization" and then turn to the causes Kelly focuses on.

As noted, the rodent that act as natural hosts of Y. Pestis are native to the Asian Steppes (Asian Prairies). The bacteria can be found in these populations today. Rats are also generally very sedimentary. Normally, they don't travel much. So one question is how was the bacteria able to travel to regions of the globe so far from its natural home. The vast system of global trade in the late 13th and early 14th helps us understand this.

## Pax Mongolica

The "Pax Mongolica" refers to a vast period of relative peace extending from East Europe to East Asia, thus allowing global trade to flourish. 

This event has many connections to other important aspects of the Middle Ages that we need to know about. Thus, please make sure to have read the Rosenwein account of the Mongolian Empire, SHMA, pp. 251-256. 

I will highlight a few key important details here. Please annotate with any thoughts/questions/links.

First, we need to remember what is happening in the Middle East. We've already seen the rising of the Turks alongside the reign of Abbasid empire. 

By 1250 both of these powers begin to fade. (For example, see SHMA, p. 207)

In their place, emerged the empire of Malmuks in the West and Mongols in the East. (See the Map on SHMA, p. 252).

The rise of the Mongolian Empire is our concern here.

Let's think about their story around a couple of central questions.

1. How did they come to power? 
2. What did their reign look like? What were some of its essential characteristics?

### How did they come to power?

{:.rquestion}
Who was the "founding" leader of the Mongolian Empire? What were some of his characteristics that made him successful?

Among the traits listed by Rosenwein (SHMA, p. 252) is the suggestion that he was driven by a "vision of world conquest". This seems important in light of the later success that the Mongol Empire had in supporting truly **global** trade. 

It's important that you have a general idea of the timeline of these major conquests. (See p. SHMA 252). Dates listed here are Rus (1230s), Poland and Hungary (1241), China (1279), Seljuk Rum (1243), __?___ (1258), and Syria (1259-1260).

{:.dquestion}
Why is 1258 a particularly important date? What important Islamic dynasty does it mark the end of?

{:.answer}
This is usually the date we mark as the end of the Abbasid empire.

### What did their reign look like? What were some of its essential characteristics?

Eventually the northwest expansion into Europe and southwest expansion into the Middle East and Africa was halted and the empire began to take on a "settled state". (See SHMA, p. 254). 

Using SHMA consider the following questions: 

{:.rquestion}
How was the empire organized? 

{:.rquestion}
How did it integrate with the cultures in conquered? 

{:.rquestion}
To what religion do the Mongols eventually convert? 

I see the final passage in SHMA, p. 254 as a nice summary. 

> "Thus the Mongols assimilated into the older civilizations of the regions that they conquered. At the same time, they greatly extended the global vision of Europeans and Muslims, opening up routes to China."

It seems that some of the Mongol success was due to their tolerant attitude to the cultures they conquered. But the Mongol's themselves did not leave these cultures unchanged. In particular, Genghis Khan's original "globalizing ambition" remained with his successors and this had the impact of awakening a global spirit in Europeans and Muslims.

The peace established across this vast area is often referred to as the "Pax Mongolica" (the Mongolian Peace) analogous to the classical Pax Romana (Roman Peace). 

Lots more information can be found here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Mongolica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Mongolica)

My favorite quote is about this "peace" is the following: 

It was commonly said that "a maiden bearing a nugget of gold on her head could wander safely throughout the realm."

While these trade networks contributed to global economic prosperity, it also created routes for disease to travel.

When rodent populations, specifically the black rat (and the fleas that attach to this rat) were displaced (presumably for ecological reasons), the Pax Mongolica (and the trade routes it enabled) established easy ways for these rats to travel vasts distances.

# Population Growth and the Great Famine

As Kelly points out the mere presence of Y. Pestis in Europe (unusual as it may be) is still not enough to explain its dramatic effects. One cause that he points to is deficient immune systems of European populations due to the "Great Famine" that occurred a few decades prior.

## Little Optimum: A Medieval Warm Period (Medieval Climate Optimum) and the Prosperity of the 12th and 13th Centuries.

Before we can talk about the "Great Famine", we need to understand or at least remind ourselves of the overall economic prosperity that Europe enjoyed in the 12th and 13th centuries. 

Historians and climate scientists refer to this period as the Medieval Warm Period (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period). Kelly refers to it (p. 58) as the "Little Optimum".

![little optimum graph](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/2000%2B_year_global_temperature_including_Medieval_Warm_Period_and_Little_Ice_Age_-_Ed_Hawkins.svg)
(By RCraig09 - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/)

This warming coincided with two developments whose connection seems fairly obvious: 

* economic growth and 
* population growth. 

It is generally agreed that all three of these developments (warming, economic growth, and population growth) were coming to an end around 1250. (See SHMA, p. 289, near the bottom). 

There is a connection to be made here between these centuries of prosperity and another development we discussed earlier, namely the rise of the university. 

In my plenary lecture on the "Rise of the Universities" I focused on the character Abelard who was born into a middle-class family. Abelard wanted to pursue an academic career, but to do that he had to travel to where the best teachers were, viz. Paris. 

Abelard is only one example of a groundswell of people who had **enough surplus wealth** to travel. As I noted in my lecture, this increased mobility is what made it possible for Europe's student population to travel to a few centralized places, Paris, Oxford, Bologna. And it was this centralization that created the conditions for the development of the University as an institution.

## The Great Famine

Rosenwein discusses "The Great Famine" in SHMA, p. 289. 

The most obvious cause seems to be, as Rosenwein says, "overpopulation and undersupply". 

But these two causes are related to climate change. The "Warm Period" appears to end by 1250 only to be followed by a "mini ice age" (SHMA, p. 289) which would clearly affect food production. At the same time, the population of Europe was at an all time high thanks to the demographic boom of the previous century. 

Kelly (p. 57) describes this as a possible Malthusian scenario where population growth reaches an unsustainable level only to be curbed by disaster (e.g. Famine or Plague). 

However, both Rosenwein (p. 292) and Kelly (p. 57) point out that climate change is not enough to account for the famine. Contemporary research suggests that The Great Famine has as much to do with human decisions and actions as it does with climate change.

Rosenwein writes: 

> "Yet scarcity and famine were hardly inevitable...Often human actions were responsible for aggravating food shortages." (SHMA, p. 292)

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

So here, rather than just summarize Rosenwein, I ask you to read her account of the human causes of the Great Famine on pp. 292-293.  Then please post some of the "human causes" you identify. 

{:.rquestion}
For example, what changes in the nature of warfare tactics were affecting food supplies. Rosenwein mentions this briefly on p. 292, but Kelly mentions this development in his account of the "war" as a cause of the plague on p. 74. 

This is a good example of how the causes of the plague intersect and intertwine, reinforcing one another. 

{:.rquestion}
Are there any other examples of this kind of intersection?

</div>

# Hygiene

Kelly's account of medieval hygiene is full of rich details that paint an evocative picture of medieval life. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
Why can hygiene be considered a contributing factor to the Black Death?

{:.rquestion}
What parts of his account really jumped out at you? What particular details interested or surprised you? (Can you point us to a particular page or passage?) 

</div>

# War

## Hundred Years' War

As noted by Kelly in the *Great Mortality*, chapter 3, one possible cause of the plague, or the catastrophic scope of the plague, was war. 

The most notorious war of the 14th century was the Hundred Years' War. We need to make sure we understand the basic causes and events of this war and how it impacted not only the plague but the larger formation of Modern Europe.

The monarchical and political history of the Hundred Years' War is complex. So, in what follows, I aim to give a high level overview. 

### Prelude 

To begin, we need to start in the 12th century and simply note that after the Battle of Hastings in 1066 and the conquest of England by the Normans, the island of England was in many ways seen by the monarchy as kind of colony. The King and his royal court primarily lived in northern and western France. 

When Henry of Anjou came to power in 1154, he was considered the first Plantagenet King (Plantagenet being a family name).

{:.dquestion}
But strangely he is also considered the first Angevin King. Why? Where does the term Angevin come from? 

{:.answer}
The term Angevin comes from land title "Anjou" which lies in the northwest part of modern-day France. 

Please look at the map in SHMA on p. 218 to get a sense of the land holdings of Henry II. 

I find this a somewhat astonishing reminder that there is nothing "necessary" or "inevitable" about the present, including its geo-political divisions. For us today England as a nation is obviously an island set apart from the European continent, while France is a nation contained entirely on the continent. However, the map on page 218 shows us how different things were in the Middle Ages and how different they could have been for us today had events like the Hundred Years' War not shaped the future in very specific ways. 

Henry II surely did not think of himself as primarily English or belonging to an island country. He spent most of his time in Anjou. His first language was probably an earlier form of French. 

All things considered Henry II was a powerful King who set up strong bureaucracies and administrative systems. (See SHMA, p. 214-220.)

But important for our story is that his sons were somewhat disappointing. 

Both of their epithets are revealing and helpful ways to remember this story.

Richard I the Lionheart succeeded his father, but as Rosenwein notes on SHMA, p. 219: "Richard was rarely in England, since half of France was his to subdue." He also wanted to be a fierce warrior but ended up being rather pathetic. In various escapades (see SHMA, p. 219), he was repeatedly captured only to be saved by expensive ransoms.

Richard died in 1199 in battle, and his brother John took his place. 

{:.dquestion}
John's epithet is Lackland. Do you remember why?

{:.answer}
Because his rule was a relative failure. He successively lost nearly all of the English holdings on the continent. Thus, he is called "John Lackland" because he "lacks the land" his Father once held. 

The end of John Lackland is the end of the "Angevin" Monarchy and the beginning of the Plantagenets. But here we must remember: the Plantagenets are of the same family as the Angevins. However, they ceased to be called Angevins to indicate their transition to primarily English holdings and English culture.

At the same time, however, the point for our concern with the Hundred Years' War in the 14th century is that English rulers had a history and expectation of holding/ruling lands on the continent. They felt as much a claim to it as the French King and French nobles did. This feeling of "right" and "claim" to France would rear its head again in the 14th century. 

### The Direct Reason for the War.

John Lackland was followed by: 

Henry III (son of John Lackland) 
Edward I (Longshanks) (The evil king in the movie *Braveheart*)
Edward II (the disappointing son in the movie *Braveheart*). 

Critically important is that Edward II married Isabelle of France, the daughter of Philip IV.

They had a child, Edward III (1327-1377), who was, through Isabelle, the grandson of Philip IV. 

Meanwhile Philip IV, had, besides Isabelle, three sons, Louis X, Philip V, and Charles IV, who after their Father's death each took over the thrown and then died in succession. When Charles IV died in 1328 with no male heir, this made Edward III in England the last male successor (as grandson) of Philip IV. 

Edward III believed this gave him a strong claim to the French crown. It was weakened only by the fact that he was related to Philip IV by the maternal line (Isabelle) rather than a paternal line. 

Edward III expected the support of French nobles, but he was disappointed. 

Instead of supporting Edward III, they threw their support to Philip VI, who was son of Charles Valois (the brother of Philip IV). 

Thus, while Edward III could claim to be a direct descendant (great-grandson) of the first-born male child of Philip III, Philip VI could claim to be the grandson of Philip III through an all-male line (albeit through the second-born son of Philip III rather than the first-born).

(See the French Genealogy in SHMA p. 313.) 

To enforce his claims, Edward III began a war against the French King in 1337 (only 10 or so years before the outbreak of the plague) which lasted until 1453. 

### Impact 

Rosenwein titles chapter 8 in SHMA, "Catastrophe and Creativity". Thus, it is reasonable to ask: in what ways, did the Hundred Years' War produce creativity? 

One answer is that it generated new political formations, especially in France. Rosenwein writes:

> "Ultimately, the war was not so much between England and France as between two conceptions of France: one, a centralized monarchy, the other, and association of territories ruled by counts and dukes. The centralized model won." (SHMA, p. 311)

One way that I think we can get a sense of how the Hundred Years' War helped create the centralized nation state that we know today as France is by comparing into the Holy Roman Empire. 

For most of its history, the Holy Roman Empire, more or less the inheritors of the eastern part of Charlemagne's empire, was never anything like a centralized state. At most, it functioned like a loose federation, often with little more than a symbolic unity through symbolic homage to someone claiming the title of emperor. 

It is important to note that, unlike the King of England for instance, there is no sense in which the "Emperor" could ever simply decree something and expect it to be executed by the kings, dukes, bishop, etc. who controlled the lands within the empire's boundaries.

In this respect, the Holy Roman Emperor functioned like the head of the UN or European Union. He could make decrees, but the realization of these decrees could never be enacted by fiat, but only through slow political negotiations with each political unit. 

To give you a sense of the complexity of the Holy Roman Empire, look at this map from 1356: 

![Map of Holy Roman Empire Fragmentation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Golden_Bull_of_1356.png)
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire#/media/File:Golden_Bull_of_1356.png)

In this regard, the empire was sometimes called a "Flickenteppich" (a wonderful German word for a "patchwork"). And Consider the following description from Wikipedia:

> "The Holy Roman Empire was not a highly centralized state like most countries today. Instead, it was divided into dozens â€“ eventually hundreds â€“ of individual entities governed by kings, dukes, counts, bishops, abbots, and other rulers, collectively known as princes. There were also some areas ruled directly by the Emperor. At no time could the Emperor simply issue decrees and govern autonomously over the Empire. His power was severely restricted by the various local leaders.
From the High Middle Ages onwards, the Holy Roman Empire was marked by an uneasy coexistence with the princes of the local territories who were struggling to take power away from it. To a greater extent than in other medieval kingdoms such as France and England, the Emperors were unable to gain much control over the lands that they formally owned. Instead, to secure their own position from the threat of being deposed, Emperors were forced to grant more and more autonomy to local rulers, both nobles, and bishops. This process began in the 11th century with the Investiture Controversy and was more or less concluded with the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. Several Emperors attempted to reverse this steady dissemination of their authority but were thwarted both by the papacy and by the princes of the Empire." (Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire)

I raise this to make a point of contrast. For much of medieval history, the French King "ruled" over a collection of smaller principalities in similar way. There was a sort of verbal recognition and homage by powerful dukes, but in reality, he could hardly be said to rule over them in a direct or forceful way. 

The power dynamic with Henry II is a good example. Henry II, who inherits the kingdom from his connection to William the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy, had claims to Normandy as its duke, and therefore he was technically a vassal of the King of France. 

But Henry II as the Duke of Normandy was much more powerful than the King of France, and there is no sense that the King of France could have actually mandated that Henry II do something that he didn't want to do.

But the claims of Edward III at the start of the Hundred Years' War forced French Dukes and other nobles to coalesce around Philip VI. The next hundred years of fighting had a similar effect of centralizing power in France, creating a powerful and centralized monarchy that would last until the French Revolution in 1789.

# Reflection on the Plague and the Pandemic
â€ƒ
<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Having lived through a modern global pandemic, we have a unique lens with which we can view the 14th century Plague. 

Based on our reading of the Black Plague (both in Kelly and Rosenwein (SHMA, pp. 308-311 ))...

{:.rquestion}
Do you see any similarities between the two pandemics? 

{:.rquestion}
Do you see any differences? 

{:.rquestion}
Are there any other important details about the the Black Death or our Pandemic that jump out as you as important and worthy of discussion? Tell us why.

# Key Takeaways

* In surveying the causes of the Black Death, we've tried to catch up on a number of important historical details of the late Middle Ages. 
* We surveyed the rise of the "Pax Mongolica" and its creation of global trade routes.
* We reviewed the Medieval Warming Period and its effect on economic prosperity and population growth. We also mentioned the effects of the Cooling Period most visible in the "Great Famine".
* We noted the state of Medieval hygiene and its contribution to the spread of disease.
* Finally, we recognized the contribution of war to the spread of disease.
  * Specifically, we surveyed the causes of the Hundred Year's war.
  * We also mentioned the geo-political effects of that war, most notably the way the war helped centralize power in France, turning it from a loose connection of principalities to centralized monarchical power.

# What's Next

* In light of all this suffering in the 14th century, we will use our last class to look at one theological response to suffering and evil in the writings of the English mystic Julian of Norwich.
