# Review.

Thus far we have discussed two catalytic causes of the First Crusade:

* Church Reform
* Military Reform

# A Third Cause of the First Crusade?

In Pope Urban II's Council of Clermont speech, he also pointed to a third cause, namely the rise of the Seljuk Turks (TFC, p. 52).
 
In the lead up to the First Crusade, the Seljuk Turks took most of Anatolia from the Byzantines. (See SHMA, p. 162, map 5.1). 

Some notes about the Seljuk Turks:

* The Seljuk Turks were a distinct ethnic group.
* They converted to Islam around 985.
* At the end of 10th century they migrated south and served as mercenaries of various rival Islamic rulers.
* In the 11th century, they migrated south and began their own conquests.
  * This pattern appears similar to the way Lombards helped the Byzantines and then became conquerors themselves.
* In 1055, they captured Baghdad (and they began using the Abbasid caliphs as figure heads).
* In 1071, they defeated the Byzantines at Manzikert (SHMA, p. 163).
  * Incidentally, this was the date (1071) that we used to mark the end of the Golden Era of Byzantine expansion (843-1071 Expansion, see [class 6](class-6.html#expansion-843-1071](https://jeffreycwitt.com/hn202/docs/class-6.html#expansion-843-1071)).
* And especially important for our story, in 1075, the Turks occupied Jerusalem. 

In response to these Turkish conquests, in January of 1095, at the Council of Piacenza, and in March of 1095 (See SHMA p. 181 and TFC, p. 52n1-2) Byzantine Emperor Alexius appealed to Pope Urban II for a small band of mercenary knights to fight the Turks who had by this time conquered most of Asia Minor.  


<div class="discussion" markdown="1">
{:.question}
Quick review: How does this show a dramatic difference between the Popes of the Carolingian era and the Popes of the 11th century?
</div>

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">
{:.dquestion}
Why might we say Tukish conquest of Jerusalem is only a "surface" cause, or as SHMA says "ostensibly", and not a real cause of the Crusade? 

{:.answer}
Because the preceding two causes -- namely the need for military reform charged with religious inspiration -- suggest that the West in a way already wanted or needed something like a Crusade. The request from Alexius, in effect, provides a convenient cover for what was already brewing.

# Tracing the Main Events

Today, I want us to walk slowly through some of the key timeline events of the first crusade (events that show up in any generic timeline of the First Crusade). In terms of your preparation, the sections below list events you should know. You should be able to explain generally what happened and why the event is significant. 

As we proceed through these events, I want us to discuss and reflect on the way this story is being told by Fulcher. We can do this best by engaging in a kind of comparison between the story as told by Fulcher and the story as told in a useful modern documentary about the First Crusade

From the very beginning, Fulcher's own account appears to reinforce the idea of the warrior saint. (See top of p. 48, “Warrior saint” idea)

> p. 48 "for, after hearing the deeds of faithful predecessors who rejected the beauties and pleasures of the world and clung to God, and in accordance with the precept of the Gospel, left their parents and wives and possessions, however great, to follow Him, those here on earth are inspired to serve Him more eagerly in that same spirit."

Given this initial orientation, let's be attentive to the way this perspective colors his narrative.

## The Call to Crusade - November 1095

As discussed last time, we know the Crusades were initiated through Pope Urban II's call to Crusade in his Council of Clermont speech in November of 1095.

## Departure from the West - Summer 1096

But note that it took a long time before the Crusade could actually get underway. Pope Urban's initial call was at the beginning of the winter in 1095. It wasn't until the summer of 1096 that the so-called "crusaders" could begin marching.

For a good map of the crusading routes, see SHMA, p. 182. See also the map below.

      <img width="512" alt="Map of First Crusade - Roads of main armies-fi" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Map_of_First_Crusade_-_Roads_of_main_armies-fi.png/512px-Map_of_First_Crusade_-_Roads_of_main_armies-fi.png"/></a>

Notice that the map suggests the "fragmentary" and "grass-roots" way that the Crusade began. Here we see different groups independently setting out on the journey. It is only at Constantinople that these different armies come together for the first time.

## Arrival Constantinople - May 14th 1097 

Make sure to read Fulcher's account (see FTC, pp. 62-64) of this arrival and then watch the video below.

(Video Time 21:52 to 28:40)

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">
<!-- 
{:.rquestion}
How does Fulcher describe the arrival and meeting at Constantinople? How does that compare to the video's description?
•	The had to camp outside
•	The emperor was very suspicious
•	p. 62: “We were not able to enter the city, since it was not pleasing to the emperor (for he feared that by chance we might plot some injury to him)…Only five or six of us at the same time were permitted to go in the city each hour”? 
-->

{:.rquestion}
Why do you think the emperor felt threatened upon arrival of the crusaders? Does this tell us anything about rival west/east perspectives about the crusading army? 

{:.rquestion}
Fulcher gives us one perspective. What are the other ways this traveling army is being perceived? How might Alexius tell the story of the arrival differently than Fulcher? 

<!-- He would be very suspicious. 

SHMA, p. 182, "the Norman warrior Bohemond, had, a few years before, tried to conquer Byzantium itself."

So, when an army of 30,000 plus people show up, this is not quite what he had in mind. -->

{:.dquestion}
Ultimately, why do you think Alexius helped the crusaders? What does he hope to gain from the Crusade?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">
Alexius makes key leaders swear an oath that the lands conquered would be returned to the Byzantine Empire.

He hopes for protection from Turks. Nicaea, as we will see, is very close to Constantinople. It was once part of the Byzantine Empire, but was recently lost.

## Nicaea (Begins May 14, 1097) 

Again, read Fulcher's account (see FTC p. 64-65) of the battle at Nicaea, then watch the video below. 

(Video Time 28:45 to 32:20)

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
What are the significant details of this battle?

{:.rquestion}
Why do the Crusaders feel double-crossed?

</div>


<!-- p. 65: "Meanwhile they parleyed with the Emperor through mediators, and slyly returned the city to him, when already it has been greatly encompassed by force and cleverness"

It sounds like there is something pejorative in this description. 

Question: Why might the Frankish crusaders feel slighted by the particular manner in which this siege ended?

They did not get the victory. They did not the spoils.
-->

In sum, the trickery and deception on both sides speaks to the growing divide and alienation between the East and West. From this perspective, historian Williston Walker nicely summarizes the tension and the role that the Crusades played in entrenching this division. Walker writes:

> "Far from aiding the Eastern Empire, they hastened its disintegration. They also revealed the continuing inability of Latin Christians to understand Greek Christians, and they hardened the schism between them." (Walker, Williston, History of the Christian Church, 1985, p. 290)

<!-- We should also keep in mind that these events are happening just after the Great Schism in 1054. (see SHMA p. 178; Doctrine of Papal Supremacy) -->

I see the arrival at Constantinople and the conquest of Nicaea as small pieces of evidence illustrating this larger point. 

They were alliances to be sure, but the Franks were marching into a foreign world as foreign conquerors. The Byzantines were fighting battles that occurred much closer to their actual homes. They were fighting for cities that until very recently were long understood to be Byzantine cities. Thus, the situation was ripe for misunderstanding and enmity. 

The case of Edessa (see below) makes this even more acute: it shows that the conflict between Byzantium and the Crusaders cannot be attributed to misunderstanding alone.

## Battle of Dorylaeum - July 1, 1097

The Battle of Dorylaeum is a major battle with lots of interesting details. I encourage you to watch the video and learn more, but if you're running short of time, you can skim this section, as we won't have much time to discuss it in class. More important for our class discussion, is the next section and the events in Edessa.

(Video Time 32:21 to 41:55)

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
Are there any details from the battle of Dorylaeum that seem particularly important to you? Tell us why these details strike you as important?
</div>

## Baldwin and Edessa - February 20, 1098 

I now want to contrast Fulcher’s narration (see TFC p. 68) of the taking of Edessa and the account given in the documentary.

Read Fulcher's account first and consider the following basic plot questions.

{:.question} 
Starting on TFC p. 68, what does Count Baldwin (the brother of Godfrey) begin to do?

{:.answer}
He separates from the army and begins sacking towns and fortifications. Eventually, he comes to Edessa.

{:.question} 
Who currently has control of Edessa? Why did they invite him in?

{:.answer}
> According to Fulcher: "And because they were unable to defend themselves from the Turks, that Greek (Thoros, an Armenian) wished to have himself and his land defended by Baldwin and his soldiers, who he had heard were very brave warriors."

{:.question} 
What happens once inside the city?

{:.answer}
Plot to overthrow Thoros (by Citizens). Baldwin magically ends up ruler. 

{:.rquestion}
How does Fulcher describe Baldwin’s involvement?

Now let's compare this account to the video account.

(Video Time 44:00 to 49:10)
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ezP7Qv_9jl8?start=2640&end=2950" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
How do the accounts differ? 

{:.rquestion}
What motivations are attributed to Baldwin in the film? 

{:.rquestion}
What reasons are suggested for why Edessa voluntary receives Baldwin? How do these reasons compare to Fulcher's account?

{:.rquestion}
Near the end of the narration, what kind of interpretation and significance do the commentators give to these events?

</div>


## Siege at Antioch - October 20, 1097

(Video Time 49:10 and 1:12:05)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ezP7Qv_9jl8?start=2950&end=4325" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
Are there any details from the Siege at Antioch that seem particularly important to you? Tell us why these details strike you as important?

{:.rquestion}
What's the story about the lance? Why it significant? What does it tell us about the mentality of the Crusaders? 

{:.rquestion}
Why does one commentator suggest that the story of the lance is a primitive form of propaganda? What does the use of propaganda tell us about the self-awareness of the leaders of the Crusade?

</div>

<!-- Reasons Antioch was desirable:
Strategic: 
It is the gateway to Syria and the gateway to the holy lands. Keeping antioch is necessary for ensuring their supply chain and for ensuring a safe return.
Spiritual: 
First church, founded by St. Peter

Interesting, there were lots of Christians living in Antioch

Question: Why was this siege difficult? 

Took a long time, after eight months they made no progress, armies started starving.

Pestilence (dissipation) broke out.

Threatened by help 

Question: Do we remember how Antioch was eventually breached?

Through treachery and betrayal. Bohemod eventually persuaded a tower guard to betray the city.

Question: How does Fulcher describe this? (p. 74-75)

Palace guard (firouz) betrayed the city. 

Why: Fulcher says he had a vision telling him to hand over the city.
Or
He was bribed by Bohemond.

## Siege and Conquest of Jerusalem - June 13 to July 15, 1099

Finally, let’s watch an account of the conquest of Jerusalem and then turn to some general reflection questions.

(Video Time 1:20 to 1:25:15)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ezP7Qv_9jl8?start=4800&end=5115" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

# Reflection 

Watch the following final reflection videos and then consider the questions below:

(Video Time 1:25:15 to 1:28:43)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ezP7Qv_9jl8?start=5115&end=5323" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Here's the clip that the commentator is referring to at the end of the last video.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7TRVcnX8Vsw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
The final video talks about the legacy of the Crusade on modern consciousness. How do you think these events and the ideas constructed through them are affecting or shaping the way we think today? What examples come to mind?

{:.rquestion}
In what ways do we continue to think or speak in the West in crusader terms?  Do we use language like Holy War, "rightfully ours," "holy suffering" to justify aggression against non-Christians, Barbarians, pagans? 

{:.rquestion}
Are there ways we read about "atrocities" committed by people we identify with differently than the atrocities committed by people we don’t as easily identify with.

{:.rquestion}
For example, do we think about ISIS beheadings somehow differently than Abu Graib? If so, why?

{:.rquestion}
Do we think about Muslim violence differently than we think about Christian/Western Violence? 

{:.rquestion}
Is this interpretation a product of our medieval past? How so?

{:.rquestion}
How did the final minutes of the video strike you? Did you find it surprising that Muslim societies still retell the events of the crusade "as if they were yesterday"? Is it strange to hear that they see them as a “barbarian” invasion?

</div>

# Key Takeaways 

* Our goal today was to get a general idea of the main events of the First Crusade and their significance.
* We also compared accounts of these stories to get a sense of the different motivations of various crusaders and how different orientations toward the Crusade lead to very different interpretations of Crusade events.

# What's Next

* Next time we're going to look at one more account of one particular crusading army known as the People's crusade.
* In this account, we are going to look closely at how Pope Urban's emphasis on the non-christian other led to unexpected hostile attitudes, not just toward Muslims, but toward Jewish communities with long histories of living in Western Europe.
