# Review and Reflection

Let's begin by calling a critical quotation from Augustine's City of God, Book 2

> "endure...."

In effect, Augustine asserts that Christians are only **pilgrims**, people on a journey in this life, who will never be at home here on earth and will never find perfect happiness in this life. 

He is certainly arguing against the notion that pagan Rome ever was a perfect city. But he is also arguing against certain rival Christian thinkers, for example [Eusebius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusebius), who saw in the Rome's tolerance and then adoption of Christianity as a state religion, a chance to create a Christian empire, a *City of God* on earth and in this life. 

Augustine's denies that this is possible. The Christian will never be at home in this life and is therefore always passing through. The Christian is a **Pilgrim** and is always passing through.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Before looking at this argument more closely, it is worth stepping back and reflecting a bit on why this "pilgrim status" might bother or worry people, or at least raise a lot of questions.

{: .dquestion}
You might think a bit about your status in Baltimore. For many students, Baltimore is a temporary home, a place you are "using" on your way to somewhere else? How does your Pilgrim status affect your relationship to the city? Are there ways it makes you (or your peers) and threat to the society? 

<div class="answer" markdown="1">
One of the most difficult and foundational tasks of political science is justifying political authority, and the coordination of collective effort through this authority. 

Why do I have to do what this person says? Why I do have to limit my natural freedom and follow this law, just because you said so? Who are you? What gives you the right to command me?

What is a plausible answer to this question?

Individuals find happiness in the city. I will submit to these laws because I want to be happy and I know that I can only be happy through participation in the city.

Augustine's position can appear dangerous because he asserting that city of God is not possible on earth and that happiness is not found in this life, he would appear to weaken the incentive for social coordination.

</div>

{: .rquestion}
Are there positives as well? Are there ways that your pilgrim status enables you to strengthen or benefit the city.

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

I do think there are also surprising ways that a "pilgrim" status can also be a benefit to the city. The belief that my happiness is to be found through my place and participation in the city, could certainly make me very protective and defensive of my "claim". A threat of injustice is a threat to my one shot at happiness. Such a person, I think, would find it difficult to sacrifice or endure small injustices for the sake of the greater good. 

The traveling pilgrim on the other hand might find it easy to sacrifice or go without if the protection of the city demands it. If someone didn't quite get their fair share, the pilgrim might shrug and say: it's ok, my happiness didn't depend on this anyway. 

Perhaps the willingness of Loyola students to engage in extra service throughout the city might be a similar example. Freed from the burden to make sure I get what's mine, I am able to give more. 

Similarly, such a person, because of their detachment, might be fairly impartial and therefore well disposed to adjudicate conflicts and disputes.

</div>

</diV>

The point, at the present, is to simply recognize that Augustine's argument for our "pilgrim" status raises a lot of difficult questions for political theorists and political practitioners. 

Is Augustine's idea of the pilgrim a political threat or is there another basis/justification for authority and social coordination? Is there something besides "earthly happiness" that binds the Christian and non-Christians together strongly enough so that Christian would feel bound to participate in the political process and the non-Christians would be willing to rely on and trust the Christian.

This is a bit of review and also a gesture toward where we are going. 

But before we go much further, let's start at the beginning of book 19 where Augustine makes his clearest argument for the pilgrim status of the members of the earthly city.

# Argument that happiness is not available in this life. (Argument for pilgrim status) (chapters 1-10)

## Varro on Happiness
{:.rquestion}
How does Augustine start this argument? Who does he argue with? (see p. 670)

Augustine begins with a re-counting of Varro's schools of philosophy and their position on the nature of happiness.

We can see these also explained on p. 670:

> "there are four things which men desire, as it were by nature without a master, without the help of any instruction..." (p. 670)

{:.question}
What are these 4 things?

{:.answer}
pleasure, repose, pleasere and repose, primary objects of nature 

But there are also different opinions about how the happy person relates to these desirable things. 

{:.question}
What are the three different ways to relate to the 4 things? (p. 670)

{:.answer}
> 670: "Now these four things ... exist in us in such sort that we must either desire virtue on their account, or them for the sake of virtue, or both for their own sake.

We can organize the divisions Augustine via Varro is creating in a table. 

||pleasure| 	repose|	pleasure & repose|	primary objects of nature|
|virtue serving x|
|x serving virtue|
|x with virtue|				

{:.question}
First which of these 12 options does Varro pick as the correct answer to what is happiness? (See chapter 3)

{:.answer}
>"But from those four things Varro eliminates three--pleasure, repose, pleasure and repose combined not because he things these are not worthy of the place assigned them, but because they are included in the primary objects of nature." (p. 673)

So we can update the chart a bit:

||pleasure|repose|pleasure & repose|primary objects of nature|
|virtue serving x |no|no|no|
|x serving virtue |no|	no|	no|
|x with virtue|no|no|no|

Early on Augustine (with Varro) quickly dismissed the life where virtue serves pleasure or the primary objects of nature and he insisted that this cannot be the happy life: 

{:.question}
Think about this for yourself for moment. Why might a certain amount of virtue be required to maximize pleasure?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">
A glutton who gets black out drunk, ceases to feel pleasure. A heroin addict quickly feels the pain of addiction and dies early. 

Thus, temperance could be an important virtue for the pursuit of maximizing pleasure. 

Or cleverness could be necessary skill to get the best kinds of pleasure. 

Augustine writes (p. 670): 

> "But when it is preferred to virtue, it is desired for its own sake, and virtue is chosen only for its sake, and to effect nothing else than the attainment or preservation of bodily pleasure. And this, indeed, is to make life hideous: for where virtue is a slave of pleasure it no longer deserves the name of virtue. 

</div>

So we can cross out another box.

||pleasure| repose|	pleasure & repose|	primary objects of nature
|virtue serving x| 	no|	no|	no|	NO|
|x serving virtue|	no|	no|	no|	
|x with virtue	|no	|no	|no	|

Leaving us with two options: Is happiness found in virtue alone or virtue plus primary goods, each pursued for their own sake. 

Varro answers on page: 675:

> 675: "The life of man, then is called, happy when it enjoys virtue and these other spiritual and bodily good things without which virtue is impossible. It is called happier if it enjoys some or many other good things which are not essential to virtue, and happiest of all, if it lacks not one of the good things which pertain to the body and the soul."

{:.question}
What kinds of primary goods are necessary for virtue? (see p. 675)

{:.answer}
> "memory and reason, and such mental faculties" (p. 675)

{:.question}
What kinds of primary goods are not necessary for virtue, but make life even better if still obtained? 

{:.answer}
> "bodily advantages, such a swiftness of foot, beauty, or strength"

In essence, Varro concludes: of course a life where virtue serves pleasure or primary good, is pretty bad. But a life where one has sufficient primary goods to practice the virtues is a pretty happy life. But the happiest life is the one where a person has virtue, and enjoys all the other goods of life that are not needed for virtue, but are still really nice to have. 

For example, you don't necessarily need to be beautiful to be virtuous. But life would probably be a lot easier and comfortable for us if in addition to being virtuous we also get to be beautiful, or healthy, etc.

And so we can end with Varro's answer:

||pleasure 	|repose	|pleasure & repose|	primary objects of nature
|virtue serving x |	no	|no	|no	|NO|
|x serving virtue|	no	|no|	no|	Kind-of|
|x with virtue|	no	|no	|no	|Yes|

## Reason why Happiness is Not Available in this Life

With this in mind we can turn to Augustine's argument for why this kind of happiness is not available in this life.

{.:rquestion}
If the practice of virtue depends on the possession of certain essential primary objects of nature, and if the best happiness comes with the possession of NON-ESSENTIAL primary objects of nature, what problem does Augustine foresee? 

Let’s start first with the idea that happiness can be found in the bodily primary goods of nature (e.g. health, fitness, strength, etc.)

{.:question}
What if I were Mark Zuckerberg or some other Billionaire? I had the best insurance plan ever? I could afford personal trainer, nutritionist, etc. Wouldn't I be happy? (Consider how Augustine's responds on p. 676)

{.:answer}
> “For when, where, how, in this life can these primary objects of nature be possessed so that they may not be assailed by unforeseen accident.” (p. 676)

{.:question}
What about with respect to the spiritual/psychic primary goods of nature? (Consider p. 676-677)

{.:answer}
> “What shall I say of the fundamental blessings of the soul, sense and intellect…” “We can scarcely, or not at all, refrain from tears…” (p. 676-677)

{.:question}
How might our simple knowledge of the fact that the bodily and spiritual goods we now possess can be lost affect our present happiness?

{.:answer}
Just knowing about this possibility adds concern and anxiety to what would otherwise be a happy moment. 

But what if we just wanted to focus on virtue, and we suggested that one could be happy by living the simple, modest and virtuous life, unconcerned with the NON-ESSENTIAL things like pleasure or beauty.

{.:question}
Question: Why can’t we count this person as perfectly happy? (consider p. 677)

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

Moral Virtues are usually only needed and enacted in times of difficulty and pain, e.g. courage in war, resistance/perseverance against temptation.

> p. 677: “In fine virtue itself…what is its occupation save to wage perpetual war with vices…”
> 
</div>

In short, Augustine does something rather clever here. 

He flips the classical thinking on its head and says: the mere need for virtue is evidence that we are not completely happy. 

We only need temperance because we still need to resist the onslaught of temptation.

We only need courage because all around us there is danger.

Augustine shows us that he imagines true happiness to be a place of effortless rest where the armor of the traditional "moral virtue” is unnecessary.

## In Sum

Once again, you can imagine how this position causes some of the political concerns we discussed at the outset.

If I don’t believe material prosperity will bring me happiness, can I be relied on to work for the benefit and material prosperity of the community?

If I'm a non-Christian resident here, can I trust my tourist Christian neighbor is going to take care of their yard, drive on the correct side of the road, and generally perform actions which help strengthen the infrastructure of the state needed for my own projects (rather than undermine them)).

If I don’t believe that happiness can be found in spiritual / virtuous well-being can I be relied on to support the cultural institutions designed to support such development.

# III. What does this mean for engagement in the world? (c. 11-21)

So, this leads us to the very serious question about what does pilgrim life look like? What does “pilgrim” status mean for engagement with the earthly world?

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{.dquestion}
Let’s start by being very blunt about what’s at stake: if I’m convinced by Augustine’s argument, why not just kill myself? Why isn’t this a proper response to “happiness is not available in this life”? Why shouldn’t we attempt to move on as quickly as possible to the next life. Are there any text passages from Augustine that suggest this is not the proper response.

{.answer}
The next life must be earned; life on earth requires a good faith effort.  (See also quote from chapter 2, we are to "endure")

</div>

If there are reasons not to kill yourself (namely, because one needs to "endure" and "work out there salvation), how does this affect the pilgrim’s interest or relation to the earthly city?

Here is where I think we need to start keeping an eye out for multitude of different and often conflicting answers about the proper conduct of an earthly pilgrim that we will see emerge through the Middle Ages.

In chapters 11-21, Augustine is going to be forward  his own answer. But is not the only that can be offered. And we want to keep our eyes out for other kinds of answers people will offer as well as the practical implications of those different answers.

{:.rquestion}
So, for Augustine, what are our responsibilities during this period of required enduring? 

First of all, we might ask, how it is even possible for the Christian and non-Christian to be part of the same city. 

It seems like there no longer is a common idea of the good or destination that can motivate people toward cooperation and ordered activity.

Some people think they are just passing through. Some people think they are trying to build happiness on earth. And various people have various ideas of what this happiness is. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
Given this variety, what could motivate people to co-ordinate action? Is there anything common other than the goal of happiness that could justify collaboration? What do both parties need in common, even if they are not heading to the same destination?

Augustine answer is that Cicero's definition is wrong. A city doesn't need to be united by a common sense of justice, but by a common need. 

{:.question}
What is this need?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

The Non-Christian/Non-pilgrim wants peace because peace is needed to acquire both virtue and the “prima natura” goods of nature.

> p. 695, c. 17: “But the families which do not live by faith seek their peace in the earthly advantages of this life; …”

In contrast, Xn Pilgrim make “use” peace to aid them in their pilgrim progress.

> p. 695, c. 17: “While the families which live by faith look for those eternal blessings which are promised, and use as pilgrims such advantages of time and of earth as do not fascinate and divert them from God, but rather aid them to endure with greater ease…

> p. 695, c. 17: “Thus the things necessary for this mortal life are used by both kinds of men and families alike, but each has its own peculiar and widely different aim in using them. The earthly city...[keep going]”

</div>
</div>


The idea that the pilgrim needs to "use" the earthly peace (and the fruits of peace) suggest that Augustine's pilgrim is not just passing through but is being given time “to work out” their salvation on earth. Augustine's pilgrim has obligations to the earthly city.

Consider the following passages:

> p. 695: "To be innocent, we must not only do harm to no man but also restrain him from sin or punish his sin, so that either the man himself who is punished may profit, or others be warned by his example"

> p. 692: “But as this divine Master inculcates two precepts – the love of God and the love of our neighbor – and as in these precepts a man finds three things he has to love – God, himself, and his neighbor – and that he who loves God loves himself thereby, it follows that he must endeavour to get his neighbor to love God, since he is ordered to love his neighbour as himself.” … p. 693 

This is an important part of understanding many of the developments we will see in the Middle Ages – it explains much of the angst seen in the medieval society concerned whether or not this “salvation” is being worked out. 

We can see this in Monasticism and Benedict’s rule which we will read in our next class (which will offer one very distinct idea of what this "endurance" should look like).

But we will see rival answers in the emergence of warrior saints during Crusades, where battle and war become possible means of sanctification.

The result of this pilgrim position creates a strange and ambiguous relation between the pilgrim and the earthly society or the “City of Man” 

On the one hand: The pilgrim is eager to see the “earthly city / the city of man” do well and remain peaceful because this is the best environment for a pilgrim “to work out their salvation”. In a way, the pilgrim seems to need this early peace.

On the other hand: But because they only mean to use the modest benefits of the city, rather than find happiness within it, their commitment to the city of man has some limits or conditions.. 

{:.question}
What are the conditions under which a pilgrim can engagement in the earthly political life? What are the conditions under which a pilgrim cannot? (see c. 17, p. 696)

> “Even the heavenly city, therefore, while it its state of pilgrimage, avails itself of the peace of earth, and, so far as it can without injuring faith and godliness, desires and maintains a common agreement among men regarding the acquisition of the necessaries of life” (p. 696, c. 17)

This is a provocative assertion that raises as many questions as it does answers? What does it mean to injure the faith? What kind of engagements injure the faith, which one’s do not? How far does our obligation to the earthly city go? 

Nevertheless, Augustine does make one thing clear here: 

Allegiance to the earthly city is **always** conditional. 

Augustine’s dramatic point, then, is to say: no city on earth will every by the City of God, and thus no earthly city can ever demand total allegiance from the pilgrim. 

**In Sum**: Augustine's pilgrim seems called to a kind of middle position. There is no sense in which Augustine seems to be saying we should become anarchists, or that we should be purposely attempting to disrupt or destroy civic life. In fact, we should be working toward the modest goal of tolerable and enduring peace.

And because they are pilgrims who do not expect to find happiness or perfect in this life, sometimes I think the pilgrim is more equipped to promote peace, through self-sacrifice and a willingness to accept less than a fair share, perhaps because they know exact justice wouldn't bring them happiness anyway.

At the same time, the maintenance of this peace and the city’s well-being is not to be sought at all costs. The pilgrim—precisely because she is a pilgrim—is also a person who is willing to disrupt, destroy, and disobey when their allegiance to the City of God comes into conflict with the demands of the City of Man. 

# IV. Concrete examples of the earthly pilgrim life?

In the time that remains let’s try to look at some of the particular ways this attitude might concretely realize itself. 

While this attitude is widely adopted in the Middle Ages, it will manifest itself in different ways. Let’s try for a moment to consider the concrete ways Augustine images that this dual citizenship will work itself out. 

{:.rquestion}
Does Augustine’s position demand anything more than the simple maintenance of peace?

The pilgrim seems required to be working for the love of God and love and neighbor. 

> p. 692: “But as this divine Master inculcates two precepts – the love of God and the love of our neighbor – and as in these precepts a man finds three things he has to love – God, himself, and his neighbor – and that he who loves God loves himself thereby, it follows that he must endeavour to get his neighbor to love God, since he is ordered to love his neighbour as himself.” … p. 693 

> “And this is the order of this concord that a man, in the first place, injure no one, and in the second, do good to everyone he can reach.”

But what then does the love of neighbor require? How much involvement in the earthly city does this demand love demand?

Again, we are raising an important question that will permeate the middle ages. This is the long-standing and vibrant medieval debate about the distinction and relative value of the Active and Contemplative Lives. 

Augustine’s own life embodies this ambiguity. On the one hand, immediately after his conversion he goes away with his friends to Cassiciacum and lives a kind of monastic existence in leisurely social contemplation. But then he returns to North Africa, he becomes bishop, and then he spends the rest of his life with all the political responsibilities of a Bishop.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

To illustrate this tension, I’d like to close by looking at one famous example from chapter 6 (pp. 681-683)

{:.rquestion}
How does Augustine’s analysis of the job of a civil servant like a judge illustrate the difficult decision over whether or not a pilgrim should take such a position?

{:.rquestion}
What are the reasons for and against becoming a civil servant?

<!-- > Important quote: p. 682: “If such a darkness shrouds social life, will a wise judge take his seat on the bench or no? Beyond question he will. For human society, which he thinks it wicked to abandon, constrains him and compels him to his duty.” -->

{:.rquestion}
Question: At the same time what makes the job of this civil servant difficult and even miserable?

</div>

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Finally, I want to consider why might be considered a positive aspect of the pilgrim status. 

Certainly, the idea that the city is filled with pilgrims or tourist who are just passing through, can, to the permanent residents, feel anarchic and problematic. 

Perhaps someone just passing through would feel little motivation to contribute to the difficult criminal justice system.

But I think there are ways Augustine's realism (and the blunt truth that happiness cannot be found in this life) can actually free one to be stronger participant in civic life. 

{:.dquestion}
Why might the self-aware pilgrim be the only one willing to take the civil servant post described above? In other words, why might the person looking to attain happiness through virtue and morality purity here and now refuse such a civic duty?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

Consider the following quotation:
> “But though we therefore acquit the judge of malice, we must none the less condemn human life as miserable” (in other words, the judge in working for justice cannot help but be complicit in injustice) (p. 682)

The pilgrim judge, as Augustine describes her, is a person that knows that peace will be less just if a person who truly cares for justice does not take the office.

Thus, they feel compelled by the duty and command to love one’s neighbor to take the office. 

Nevertheless, this person knows that this position will pull them into all kinds of complicity and difficult. 

These mistakes are not described by Augustine as sin or culpable, but they are evidence of how wretched this life is. Even when one is doing their duty, doing the right thing, injustice is being perpetuated.

A person only concerned with comfort may easily refuse such a position. And the person concerned to find happiness through perfect virtue in this life would likely run from such a position, as a way of retaining their moral purity. [consider this in the light of monasticism? In what sense is monasticism susceptible to this critique?]

</div>

{:.dquestion}
Finally But how might a judge who is aware of the imperfectness of justice in this life, rule differently than someone who thinks they really live a just regime and the judgments of that regime are without flaw?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

Augustine seems to suggest that he will be overcome by the awareness of his imperfection and the weight of the responsibility.

See c. 6, p. 683, top:

This suggests that such a judge would engage in leadership with a profound sense of humility.

This sentiment is captured in a quote by the 20th century political thinker Reinhold Niebuhr

> “Any justice which is only justice soon degenerates into something less than justice. It must be saved by something which is more than justice.”—Moral Man and Immoral Society: A Study of Ethics and Politics by Reinhold Niebuhr, pg. 258

And that something more for Niebuhr is love, or more applicable here, we might say, self-sacrifice, the willingness to take less than your fair share.

Again he says:

> “In so far as justice admits the claims of the self, it is something less than love. Yet it cannot exist without love and remain justice. For without the ‘grace’ of love, justice always degenerates into something less than justice.”—Love and Justice: Selections from the Shorter Writings of Reinhold Niebuhr (edited by D.B. Robertson) (can't find page number)

In this case, a Pilgrim, aware of the imperfectness of society, would likely work to err on the side of humility, in a way someone who believes in the perfection of Justice in their society, court system, or in themselves might not. As Niebuhr suggest, such moral certainty often leads us to much less just result.
