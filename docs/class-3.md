# Review

Quote from book 2 "endure...."

In effect, he asserts that Christians are only pilgrims, people, on a journey in this life, who will never be at home here and will never find perfect happiness here. 

In many ways he is going to be arguing as much as against Eusebius as he is the romans. 

But there are also some real worries in his position. 

Question: If you were leader of city, why might you be worried about Augustine's position? Why might you see it as a threat to the Polis, to the city?

One of the most difficult and foundational tasks of political science is justifying political authority, and the coordination of collective effort through this authority. 

Why do I have to do what this person says? Why I do have to limit my natural freedom and follow this law, just because you said so? Who are you? What gives you the right to command me?

What is a plausible answer to this question?

Individuals find happiness in the city. I will submit to these laws because I want to be happy and I know that I can only be happy through participation in the city.

Augustine's position can appear dangerous because he asserting that city of God is not possible on earth and that happiness is not found in this life, he would appear to weaken the incentive for social coordination.

We have to ask is this the whole of the story? 

Is Augustine's idea of the pilgrim a political threat or is there another basis/justification for authority and social coordination? (Something that binds Xn and non-Christians together strongly enough so that non-Christians would be willing to rely on and trust Xns.)

And to what degree does our participation in the "earthly city" change due to our pilgrim status. (Is there a point where the non-Xn neighbor cannot rely/trust the Xn).

So, this is a bit of review and also a gesture toward where we are going. 

Before we get too far with this, let start at the beginning of book 19 where Augustine makes his clearest argument for the pilgrim status of the members of the earthly city.

# Argument that happiness is not available in this life. (Argument for pilgrim status) (chapters 1-10)

Question:  How does Augustine start this argument? Who does he argue with?

Augustine begins with a re-counting of Varro's schools of philosophy and their position on the nature of happiness.

We can see these also explained on p. 670:

670: "there are our things which men desire, as it were by nature without a master, without the help of any instruction..." 

Question: What are these 4 things?

But there are also different opinions about how the happy person relates to these desirable things. 

Question: What are the three different ways to relate to the 4 things?

670: "Now these four things ... exist in us in such sort that we must either desire virtue on their account, or them for the sake of virtue, or both for their own sake.

||pleasure| 	repose|	pleasure & repose|	primary objects of nature|
|virtue serving x|
|x serving virtue|
|x with virtue|				

First which of these 12 options does Varro pick as the correct answer to what is happiness? (See chapter 3)

p. 673: But from those four things Varro eliminates three--pleasure, repose, pleasure and repose combined not because he things these are not worthy of the place assigned them, but because they are included in the primary objects of nature. 

||pleasure|repose|pleasure & repose|primary objects of nature|
|virtue serving x |no|no|no|
|x serving virtue |no|	no|	no|
|x with virtue|no|no|no|

Early on Augustine (with Varro) quickly dismissed the life where virtue serves pleasure or the primary objects of nature and insisted that this cannot be the happy life: 

{:.question}
Think about this for yourself for moment. Why might a certain amount of virtue be required to maximize pleasure?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">
A glutton who gets black out drunk, ceases to feel pleasure. A heroin addict quickly feels the pain of addiction and dies early. 

Thus, temperance could be an important virtue for the pursuit of maximizing pleasure. 

Or cleverness could be necessary skill to get the best kinds of pleasure. 

Augustine writes (p. 670): 

> "But when it is preferred to virtue, it is desired for its own sake, and virtue is chosen only for its sake, and to effect nothing else than the attainment or preservation of bodily pleasure. And this, indeed, is to make life hideous: for where virtue is a slave of pleasure it no longer deserves the name of virtue. 

</div>

So we can cross out another box.

||pleasure| repose|	pleasure & repose|	primary objects of nature
|virtue serving x| 	no|	no|	no|	NO|
|x serving virtue|	no|	no|	no|	
|x with virtue	|no	|no	|no	|

Leaving us with two options. Is happiness found in virtue alone or virtue plus primary goods, each for their own sake. 

Varro answers on page: 675:

> 675: "The life of man, then is called, happy when it enjoys virtue and these other spiritual and bodily good things without which virtue is impossible. It is called happier if it enjoys some or many other good things which are not essential to virtue, and happiest of all, if it lacks not one of the good things which pertain to the body and the soul."

{:.question}
Question: What kinds of primary goods are necessary for virtue? (see p. 675)

{:.answer}
> "memory and reason, and such mental faculties" (p. 675)

{:.question}
Question: What kinds of primary goods are not necessary for virtue, but make life even better if still obtained? 

{:.answer}
> "bodily advantages, such a swiftness of foot, beauty, or strength"

In essence, Varro concludes, of course a life where virtue serves pleasure or primary good, is pretty bad. But a life where one has sufficient primary goods to practice virtues is a pretty happy life. But the happiest life is the one where a person has virtue, and enjoys all the other goods of life that are not needed for virtue, but are still really nice to have. 

For example, you don't necessarily need to be beautiful to be virtuous. But life would probably be a lot easier and comfortable for us if in addition to be virtuous we also get to be beautiful, or healthy, etc.

And so we hand with Varro's answer.
||pleasure 	|repose	|pleasure & repose|	primary objects of nature
|virtue serving x |	no	|no	|no	|NO|
|x serving virtue|	no	|no|	no|	Kind-of|
|x with virtue|	no	|no	|no	|Yes|

{.:rquestion}
Question: So, what are Augustine’s reasons why this kind of happiness is not available in this life?

{.:rquestion}
Question: If the practice of virtue depends on the possession of certain essential primary objects of nature, and if the best happiness comes with the possession of NON-ESSENTIAL primary objects of nature, what problem does Augustine foresee? 

Let’s start first with the idea that happiness can be found in the bodily primary goods of nature (e.g. health, fitness, strength, etc.)

{.:question}
What if I were Mark Zuckerberg or some other Billionaire? I had the best insurance plan ever? I could afford personal trainer, nutritionist, etc. Wouldn't I be happy?

{.:answer}
Answer: p. 676: “For when, where, how, in this life can these primary objects of nature be possessed so that they may not be assailed by unforeseen accident.”

{.:question}
What about with respect to the spiritual/psychic primary goods of nature?

{.:answer}
> p. 676-677: “What shall I say of the fundamental blessings of the soul, sense and intellect…” “We can scarcely, or not at all, refrain from tears…”

{.:question}
How might our simple knowledge of the fact that the bodily and spiritual goods we now possess can be lost affect our present happiness?

{.:answer}
Answer: Just knowing about this possibility adds concern and anxiety to what would otherwise be a happy moment. 

But if we just wanted to focus on Virtue, and we suggested that one could be happy by living the simple, modest and virtuous life, unconcerned with the NON-ESSENTIAL things like pleasure or beauty.

{.:question}
Question: Why can’t we count this person as perfectly happy?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">
Moral Virtues can often be enacted in times of difficulty and pain, e.g. courage in war, resistance/perseverance against temptation.

> p. 677: “In fine virtue itself…what is its occupation save to wage perpetual war with vices…”
</div>

In short, Augustine does something rather clever here. 

He flips the classical thinking on its head and says: the mere need for virtue is evidence that we are not completely happy. 

We only need temperance because, we still need to resist the onslaught of temptation.

We only need courage because all around us there is danger.

Augustine shows us that he imagines true happiness to be a place of effortless rest where the armor of the traditional "moral virtue” is unnecessary.

The result of this argument in chapter 1-10 is, in my view, Augustine’s clearest argument for our pilgrim status. 

---

But you can imagine how this causes some of the political concerns I mentioned at the outset.

If I don’t believe material prosperity will bring me happiness, can I be relied on to work for the benefit and material prosperity of the community?

(If I'm a non-Christian resident here, can I trust my tourist Xn neighbor is going to take care of their yard, drive on the correct side of the road, and generally perform actions which help strengthen the infrastructure of the state needed for my own projects (rather than undermine them)).

If I don’t believe that happiness can be found in spiritual well-being can I be relied on to support the cultural institutions designed to support such development.

# III. What does this mean for engagement in the world? (c. 11-21)

So, this leads us to the very serious question about what does pilgrim life look like? What does “pilgrim” status mean for engagement with the earthly world?

{.question}
Question: Let’s start by being very blunt about what’s at stake: if I’m convinced by Augustine’s argument, why not just kill myself? Why isn’t this a proper response to “happiness is not available in this life”? Why shouldn’t we attempt to move on as quickly as possible to the next life.

{.answer}
Answer: The next life must be earned; life on earth requires a good faith effort.  (See also quote from chapter 2, we are to "endure")

{.question}
If this is the case, how does this affect the pilgrim’s interest or relation to the earthly city?

[And here is where I think you start keeping an eye out for multitude of different and often conflicting answers, that we will see put forward throughout the middle Ages. Here I think Augustine is going to be forward a least part of his own answer. But is not the only that can be offered. And we want to keep our eyes to see what other kinds of answers people are offering, and the practical implications of those different answers]

So, for Augustine, what are our responsibilities during this period of required enduring? 

First of all, we might ask, how it is even possible for the Xn and non-Xn to be part of the same city. 

It seems like there no longer a common idea of the good or destination that can motivate people toward cooperation and ordered activity.

Some people think they are just passing through. Some people think they are trying to build happiness on earth. And various people have various ideas of what this happiness is. 

{:.rquestion}
Given this variety, what could motivate people to co-ordinate action Any ideas?

Augustine answer is that Cicero's definition is wrong. A city doesn't need to be united by a common sense of justice, but by a common need. 

What is this need?

The Non-Christian/Non-pilgrim wants peace because peace is needed to acquire both virtue and the “prima natura” goods of nature.

> p. 695, c. 17: “But the families which do not live by faith seek their peace in the earthly advantages of this life; …”

In contrast, Xn Pilgrim make “use” peace to aid them in their pilgrim progress.

> p. 695, c. 17: “While the families which live by faith look for those eternal blessings which are promised, and use as pilgrims such advantages of time and of earth as do not fascinate and divert them from God, but rather aid them to endure with greater ease…

> p. 695, c. 17: “Thus the things necessary for this mortal life are used by both kinds of men and families alike, but each has its own peculiar and widely different aim in using them. The earthly city...[keep going]”

But why does the pilgrim need this stuff? How does this help us clarify what Augustine expect our "endurance" to look like? 

<div class="discussion">
Question: What are we supposed to be doing while we endure this earthly life, such that we need peace and other primary goods of nature?

	[discuss ideas] 

</div>

I think this gives us a picture that the pilgrim is not just passing through but is being given time “to work out” their salvation on earth.

> p. 695: "To be innocent, we must not only do harm to no man but also restrain him from sin or punish his sin, so that either the man himself who is punished may profit, or others be warned by his example"

[what does "love thy neighbor" command look like for Xn? Xn must be interested in a peaceful society, so that it can engage in practice of "loving thy neighbor[augustine quote??]]

> p. 692: “But as this divine Master inculcates two precepts – the love of God and the love of our neighbor – and as in these precepts a man finds three things he has to love – God, himself, and his neighbor – and that he who loves God loves himself thereby, it follows that he must endeavour to get his neighbor to love God, since he is ordered to love his neighbour as himself.” … p. 693 

This is an important part of understanding many of the developments we will see in the middle ages – it explains much of the angst seen in the medieval society concerned whether or not this “salvation” is being worked out. 

We can see this in Monasticism and Benedict’s rule which we will read for tomorrow (which will offer one very distinct idea of what this "endurance" should look like)

But we will see rival answers in the emergence of warrior saints during Crusades, where battle and war become possible means of sanctification.

The result of this pilgrim position creates a strange and ambiguous relation between the pilgrim and the earthly society or the “City of Man” 

On the one hand: The pilgrim is in one sense eager to see the “earthly city / the city of man” do well and remain peaceful because this is the best environment for a pilgrim “to work out their salvation”. In a way, the pilgrim seems to need this early peace.

On the other hand: But because they only mean to use the modest benefits of the city, rather than find happiness within it, their commitment to the city of man has some limits or conditions.. 

Question: What are the conditions under which a pilgrim can engagement in the earthly political life? What are the conditions under which a pilgrim cannot?

> p. 696, c. 17: “Even the heavenly city, therefore, while it its state of pilgrimage, avails itself of the peace of earth, and, so far as it can without injuring faith and godliness, desires and maintains a common agreement among men regarding the acquisition of the necessaries of life”

This is a provocative assertion that raises as many questions as it does answers? What does it mean to injure the faith? What kind of engagements injure the faith, which one’s do not? How far does our obligation to the earthly city go? 

Nevertheless, Augustine does make one thing clear here: 

Allegiance to the earthly city is always conditional. 

Augustine’s dramatic point, then, is to say: no city on earth will every by the City of God, and thus no earthly city can ever demand total allegiance from the pilgrim. 

In Sum: Pilgrim seems called to a kind of middle position. There is no sense in which Augustine seems to be saying we should become anarchists, or that we should be purposely attempting to disrupt or destroy civic life. In fact, we should be working toward the modest goal of tolerable and enduring peace.

And because they are pilgrims who do not expect to find happiness or perfect in this life, sometimes I think the pilgrim is more equipped to promote peace, through self-sacrifice and a willingness to accept less than a fair share, perhaps because they know exact justice wouldn't bring them happiness anyway.

At the same time, the maintenance of this peace and the city’s well-being is not to be sought at all costs. The pilgrim—precisely because she is a pilgrim—is also a person who is willing to disrupt, destroy, and disobey when their allegiance to the City of God comes into conflict with the demands of the City of Man. 

## Concrete examples of the earthly pilgrim life?

In the time that remains let’s try to look at some of the particular ways this attitude might concretely realize itself. 

While this attitude is widely adopted in the middle ages, it will manifest itself in different ways, let’s try for a moment to consider the concrete ways Augustine images that this dual citizenship will work itself out. 

Question: Does Augustine’s position demand anything more than the simple maintenance of peace?

The pilgrim seems required to be working for the love of God and love and neighbor. 

> p. 692: “But as this divine Master inculcates two precepts – the love of God and the love of our neighbor – and as in these precepts a man finds three things he has to love – God, himself, and his neighbor – and that he who loves God loves himself thereby, it follows that he must endeavour to get his neighbor to love God, since he is ordered to love his neighbour as himself.” … p. 693 

> “And this is the order of this concord that a man, in the first place, injure no one, and in the second, do good to everyone he can reach.”

But what then does the love of neighbor require? How much involvement in the earthly city does this demand love demand?

Again, we are raising an important question that will permeate the middle ages. This is the long-standing and vibrant medieval debate about the distinction and relative value of the Active and Contemplative Lives. 

Augustine’s own life embodies this ambiguity. On the one hand, immediately after his conversion he goes away with his friends to Cassiciacum and life a kind of monastic existence in leisurely social contemplation. But then he returns to North Africa, is made bishop, and spends the rest of his life with all the political responsibilities of a Bishop.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

To illustrate this tension, I’d like to close by looking at one famous example from chapter 6 (pp. 681-683)

Question: How does Augustine’s analysis of the job of a civil servant like a judge illustrate the difficult decision over whether or not a pilgrim should take such a position?

Question: What are the reasons for and against becoming a civil servant?

> Important quote: p. 682: “If such a darkness shrouds social life, will a wise judge take his seat on the bench or no? Beyond question he will. For human society, which he thinks it wicked to abandon, constrains him and compels him to his duty.”

Question: At the same time what makes the job of this civil servant difficult and even miserable?
 
(Ignorance. He will be complicit in justice in the very act of trying to do good)
</div>

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">
Finally, I want to consider why might be considered a positive aspect of the pilgrim status. 

Certainly, the idea that the city is filled with pilgrims or tourist who are just passing through, can, to the permanent residents, feel anarchic and problematic. 

Question: How so?

Perhaps someone just passing through would feel little motivation to contribute to the difficult criminal justice system.

But I think there are ways Augustine's realism (and the blunt truth that happiness cannot be found in this life) can actually free one to be stronger participant in civic life. 

Question: How so?

Question: Why might the self-aware pilgrim be the only one willing to take this post? In other words, why might the person looking to attain happiness through virtue and morality purity here and now refuse such a civic duty?
</div>

Important quote: p. 682: “But though we therefore acquit the judge of malice, we must none the less condemn human life as miserable” (in other words, the judge in working for justice cannot help but be complicit in injustice).

The pilgrim judge, as Augustine describes her, is a person that knows that peace will be less just if a person who truly cares for justice does not take the office.

Thus, they feel compelled by the duty and command to love one’s neighbor to take the office. 

Nevertheless, this person knows that this position will pull them into all kinds of complicity and difficult. 

These mistakes are not described by Augustine as sin or culpable, but they are evidence of how wretched this life is. Even when one is doing their duty, doing the right thing, injustice is being perpetuated.

A person only concerned with comfort may easily refuse such a position. And the person concerned to find happiness through perfect virtue in this life would likely run from such a position, as a way of retaining their moral purity. [consider this in the light of monasticism? In what sense is monasticism susceptible to this critique?]

Question: But how might a judge who is aware of the imperfectness of justice in this life, rule differently than someone who thinks they really live a just regime and the judgments of that regime are without flaw.

Augustine seems to suggest that he will be overcome by the awareness of his imperfection and the weight of the responsibility.

See c. 6, p. 683, top:

To me, this suggests that such a judge would engage in leadership with a profound sense of humility.

To me this sentiment is captured in a quote by the 20th century political thinker Reinhold Niebuhr

[handout? ] “Any justice which is only justice soon degenerates into something less than justice. It must be saved by something which is more than justice.”—Moral Man and Immoral Society: A Study of Ethics and Politics by Reinhold Niebuhr, pg. 258

And that something more for Niebuhr is love, or more applicable here, we might say, self-sacrifice, the willingness to take less than your fair share.

Again he says:

“In so far as justice admits the claims of the self, it is something less than love. Yet it cannot exist without love and remain justice. For without the ‘grace’ of love, justice always degenerates into something less than justice.”—Love and Justice: Selections from the Shorter Writings of Reinhold Niebuhr (edited by D.B. Robertson) (can't find page number)

In this case, a Pilgrim, aware of the imperfectness of society, would likely work to err on the side of humility, in a way someone who believes in the perfection of Justice in their society, court system, or in themselves might not. As Niebuhr suggest, such moral certainty often leads us to much less just result.
