# Intro 

Our goals for today are to get a general understanding of how Monasticism spread, developed, and continually reformed itself during the course of the Middle Ages. 

One of our goals is to make sure we understand this history and the basic timeline; but secondly and more abstractly, we want to continue to examine that tensions between the monastery and the earthly city. Thus, in the back of our mind, we ought to keep asking questions like the following: 

* To what extent is the monastery really secluded from the world? 
* Does the monastery rely/depend on the earthly city or is it completely self-sufficient? 
* To what extent does the monastery, through its attempted seclusion, draw the world to it? 
* To what extent is the monastery drawn to the world, despite its attempt to withdraw?
* Is Augustine's mixed society found within the monastery or left outside the walls? 

In what follows, let's work through some of the main history of medieval monasticism while keeping these kinds of questions in mind. Wherever you notice a connection between the historical events and these kinds of questions, please note it with an annotation.

# Early Monasticism

Here in bullet point form are a few main events that were important for the early spread of Monasticism.

* 480 - Benedict is born 480.
  * This hard to find in our textbooks, but [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_of_Nursia) suggests 480. Late 5th century is sufficient for our purposes.
* 540 - Benedict composes his rule around 540 (according to BSB, "intro", p. vii).
  * This is a rough approximation; SHMA p. 28 says that he wrote it between 530 and 560.
* 545 - Benedict dies around 545 (according to BSB, "intro", p. xxii).
  * Again a rough approximation; SHMA gives a death date of circa 550/560.
* 545 - Benedict sends Brother Maurus to Gaul.
  *  Near the end of his life, after establishing several monasteries in Italy, Benedict sends brother “Maurus” to Gaul to build a monastery. This is the beginning of Benedictine Monasticism in Gaul/France. (BSB, "intro", p. xxii).
* 597 - Pope Gregory sens Augustine of Canterbury to England as a missionary.
  * Augustine presumably brought Benedict’s rule with him as he sought to establish a monastery in the still pagan Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms.
  * The Anglo-Saxons are another migratory group that migrated west to the British Isles during the fragmentation of the Roman Empire.
  * These Anglo-Saxon migrations occurred roughly between 410 and 560. 
  * Augustine sets out for the Kingdom of Kent, ruled by Aethelberht, who, while a non-Christian, was already married to a Christian Queen, named Bertha).
  * Aethelberht converted and Augustine set up a monastery in Canterbury, the ruins of which you can still see today.

And you can see these ruins stand in the shadow of the great medieval cathedral of Canterbury, which would not begin construction on its current until the 11th century.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.dquestion}

Having read read the rule of St. Benedict, do you have any guesses about the keys to its success? It was after all not the only guide to communal living or ascetic practice, so why is it this "Rule" that got disseminated so widely throughout Europe?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

* It was moderate (compared to other rules, such as those demanded by the desert fathers, or Irish Asceticism)
* It encouraged community.
* It was precise enough to be useful, but flexible enough to be used on a grand scale.
* It also demanded and enforced manual labor, which may be in part a key to the early financial success of these communities. 
  * Through strong leaders (precisely what was lacking in the sparsely settled, war torn landscape of western Europe) labor could be divided in efficient ways that allowed monks leisure time for other activities.
* This surplus of time also allowed monks in the monastery to engage in another activity that was likely even more critical to their long-term institutional, financial, and even worldly success.
  * Prayer.

# Later Monasticism

## Cluniac Monasticism

In the 10th century, we see the foundation of Benedictine Abbey in Cluny France, founded in 909/910 by William I, the first Abbot of which was Abbot Berno.

It is important right away to see the Cluny Monastery as inspired by a reform spirit.

{:.question}
From a historian's point of view, why are reform movements revealing? 

{:.answer}
Attempted reforms help us see what was actually happening (beyond the aspirational). They help us see the real life lived that often goes un-reported when people are trying to put their best face forward. 

The reforms that we see the Cluny Monastery trying to make tell us something about what Benedictine monasticism had become near the end of the 9th century.

Since our reading (Lynch) jumps right in with a discussion of Cluny's own need for reform, let me provide a little bit background about Cluny itself.

Cluny was founded in 909/910. The monks who founded the Monastery at Cluny were driven by a reform spirit. They intended to remedy a perceived lack of rigor that was apparent in the monasteries. This lack of rigor was often thought to be the result of compromises made by tight bonds between monasteries and their feudal lords, on whose lands the monks needed to live. Churches and Monastery that were settled on the land of feudal lord to whom the church/monastery owed allegiance were called [proprietary churches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_church.). Proprietary churches led to lay abbacies, meaning the appointment by a feudal lord of a lay (non-monk) overseer. Under such conditions rigorous observance of Benedict's rule often ceased and the monastery primarily became a wealth producing institution. 

We are going to return briefly to the notion of a proprietary church in the lead up to the First Crusade. But let me just quote a couple of passages from an expert, Uta-Renate Blumenthal. Blumenthal writes:

> "[by the late 9th century] many monasteries and chapters of canons had ceased to function as religious communities. ... The proprietary churches system and the lay abbacies under the heirs of Louis the Pious (son of Charlemagne) were responsible for this state of affairs. The proprietor and/or abbot would change with every turn in military fortune. Often abbeys were turned in fortresses and made to serve as domicile for the lord of the monastery with his troops and his wife, children, dogs, and horses." (Blumenthal, *The Investiture Controversy*, p. 4)

It is important, then, that when Cluny was established by Duke William of Aquitaine there was something unique about the initial charter. Duke William gave the land to the monks outright to be completely free from outside control. Again, Blumenthal writes:

>  "The foundation charter of William the Pious of 909 was rather unusual, for it immediately protected the monastery and its property from abbatial elections, and subjected the monastery to protection from the Holy See." (Blumenthal, *The Investiture Controversy*, p. 11)

With this charter, Cluny was free from influence from any outside feudal lord. Freed from these outside pressures, they were able to return to what they saw as a more authentic form of Benedictine Monasticism. This included a renewed emphasis on liturgy and prayer for which they became quite famous. 

<!-- > [http://www.vlib.us/medieval/lectures/cluny.html] “William had acquired a piece of land in Burgundy, so far distant that he would not be able to hold it. Rather than relinquish it, he established it as a monastery on the same basis at Gerald's institution at Aurillac. Considering that the Alps separating France from Italy were dangerous and difficult, and the pope was, to all intents and purposes, a puppet of Roman local politics, William's new monastery of Cluny was completely independent."

> [http://www.vlib.us/medieval/lectures/cluny.html] "When he became the abbot of Cluny, he undertook to make it a center of reform. The first step was to impose a strict discipline upon the community, such that secular visitors were struck and awed. Local families began to support Cluny with the sons and with endowments in exchange for the monk's prayers. Soon, nobles and bishops were asking Cluny to reform their own churches and monasteries. Cluny did so, but only on the condition that the reformed establishments would then belong to Cluny and be independent of local officials. These reformed houses, and new ones established by Cluny, did not have abbots, but priors, second-in-command subject to the abbot of Cluny. These priors periodically held assemblies at Cluny where they would discuss their problems and recommend measures that the abbot would make official policy. In this fashion, reform initiatives from all over western Europe were considered at Cluny and the entire weight of the Cluniac organization was thrown behind those considered worthy of such support. Cluny became, in many ways, the dynamo that powered the engine of reform directed toward rescuing the Church from feudalism and rescuing lay society as well." [http://www.vlib.us/medieval/lectures/cluny.html] -->

With this background in mind, we can turn to our reading from Lynch. Lynch opens by saying: 

> "In 1095 Cluny was at the height of its influence, the very model of how a fervent Benedictine monastic life should be carried out." (Lynch, "Monastic Life: The Twelfth Century, 197)

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.dquestion}
So what happened? Based on your reading, how did Cluny monasticism develop and ultimately come to be seen as standing in need of reform itself? Can you point us to some helpful passages from the reading?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

* It Practiced a CENTRALIZED form of governance that became hard to control as the number of houses increased. 
* Reformed houses became dependents on Cluny. They did not have their own abbot but had priors taking direction from the single abbot at Cluny.

> "By 1095, the Cluniac order had expanded far beyond an abbot’s ability to supervise the hundreds of houses subject to his rule. Because of the distance and numbers, many Cluniac houses never saw the abbot of Cluny. The consequences were a slackening of observance in many houses, which was reflected in the violations of rules against eating meat, in accepting unsuitable candidates, in internal quarrels and in a lifestyle that was sometimes more worldly than monks should live." (Lynch, p. 198)

</div>
</div>

A couple key of developments contributed to the need for reform.

First, eventually, and perhaps ironically for a movement that began by trying to extricate it from worldly concerns, they became extremely wealthy.

Paul Freedman, at Yale, has an interesting way of explaining this. 
Freedman notes that, even as the Monks attempted to remove themselves from the world, the world followed them for their prayers. In devoting their life to prayer, they were generally viewed as place of spiritual power. 

<div markdown="1">

Consider this clip from 1:59 to 3:40

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TswDu-EXHYg?start=119&end=220" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p><span class="vda">Video Discussion Anchor</span></p>

</div>

Thus, because Cluny monks excelled in liturgy and prayer, people outside the monastery, often very wealthy people, began to ask for personal prayers in exchange for lavish gifts.

Second, as their influence, wealth, and property grew, Cluny Abbots had an increased interest in matters of state (see Lynch, p. 199). Cluny Abbots participated in state councils and advised princes and kings.

For the reforming movements that follow, such political concerns were an external distraction that Benedict sought to leave outside the door of the monastery. 

In general, the series of reform movements that follow illustrates this dialectic back and forth between a desire to withdraw from the world and a popularity and power that comes as a result of that withdrawal.

# Monasteries: Learning and the Preservation of Culture

Finally, I want close by looking at a second characteristic (in addition to prayer and seclusion) that medieval monasticism is famous for and consider how it develops.

{:.question}
Besides prayer, what do monasteries (at least western medieval monasteries) seem most famous for in the popular imagination.

{:.answer}
Many people might point to "book learning" and "book copying". Monks as preservers of literary culture.

But we really need to stop and consider whether this development is obvious or inevitable. 

Where, for example, in Benedict's Rule are monks told to devote themselves to copying books, study, and the preservation of literary culture?

Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, Benedict's Rule has incredibly little to say about the importance of learning, the preservation of culture, or scientific exploration.

(As an aside, this might say something about Benedict's own attitude about what it means to be a pilgrim. What, he might ask, is the value of gathering knowledge about a world that he hopes to leave behind?)

There is one small place in the rule where we find some directives to study and read.

Consider rule 58:

> During Lent they should all be given a book from the library which they should read from cover to cover" (BSB, p. 73; see also Cochelin, “When Monks Were the Book”, p. 66-67).

Notice that time is carved out for such reading only in penitential seasons, as though private study was a kind of required penance rather than something pleasant to be pursued for its own sake.

However, we should notice the mention of a "library". Having a library is not a priority for Benedict, but it is an indirect necessity of the requirement that monks read "a book" during Lent. If they are going to read books during this penitential season, the monastery must have some books on hand for them to read. This creates the general expectation that all monasteries should have a library with books available. Thus, copying and preserving books becomes a natural by-product of this requirement.

Still there is a little here to suggest that monks should be preserving the books of classical pagan culture.

So, the question remains, where do we get this association of monasticism as the protectors of classical texts and learning?

For this, we need to jump back to the 6th century and introduce one new figure.

This figure is Cassiodorus. Along with Boethius, Cassiodorus is considered one of the last vestiges of Roman intellectuals.

His dates are from roughly 485-585, and he lived and worked and Italy.

{:.question}
Quick review question: Given these dates, with what kingdom does this align him?

{:.answer}
Cassiodorus served in the administration of Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostragoths, until around 535 when the Ostragoth kingdom was breaking down and Justinian I, the Eastern Roman Emperor, began his military campaign to retake the Italian peninsula.

Near the end of his life, Cassiodorus establishes his own monastery in Italy at Vivarium in Southern Italy. 

Cassiodorus also wrote a book called the *Institutions*, and the *Institutions* was meant to be guide or introduction for the proper study of scripture.

What Cassiodorus adds to Benedict's demand for daily meditation of the Bible is the idea that the Bible is a book that requires "interpretation". Accordingly, proper interpretation requires training and instruction. This requirement opens the door to the need for study and training in a whole new set of disciplines.

Thus, Cassiodorus's *Institutions* (and commentaries on Scripture) lays out an educational plan that would help shape the core of a medieval "liberal arts" education -- which you can see still reflected in our own lives at a liberal arts school that has a requirement for training in a core set of disciplines.

Considering the following excerpt from the prologue to the *Institutions*. [Click here to see the full text](https://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/inst-trans.html)


> "1.  When I realized there was such a zealous and eager pursuit of
secular learning, that the majority of mankind hope thereby to
obtain worldly wisdom, I was deeply grieved that Holy Scripture
lacked public teachers since secular authors certainly have a
powerful and widespread tradition.  Together with blessed
Agapetus, Pope of Rome, I made efforts to collect money for
expenses to enable Christian schools in the city of Rome to
employ learned teachers from whom the faithful might gain eternal
salvation for their souls and the adornment of fine, pure
eloquence for their speech.  They say that such a system existed
for a long time at Alexandria and that the Hebrews are now using
it enthusiastically in Nisibis, a city of Syria.  But since I
could not accomplish this task because of continual wars and
raging battles in the Kingdom of Italy--for peaceful endeavors
have no place in a time of unrest--I was moved by divine love to
devise for you, with God's help, these introductory books to take
the place of a teacher.  Through them, God willing, I believe
that the textual disposition of Holy Scripture and a compact
sketch of secular letters may be unfolded. These works may seem
unscholarly since in them you will find not fine eloquence but
basic description.  But they are of great use to anyone who seeks
to know the source both of worldly knowledge and of the salvation
of the soul.  I transmit in them not my own teaching, but the
words of earlier writers which we justly praise and gloriously
herald to later generations.  Any mention of the ancients in the
midst of praising the Lord is not considered tasteless boasting. 
Furthermore, you indicate your satisfaction with a serious
teacher if you question him often; even if you return many times
to these books, you will not be checked by any severity."

> "2.  Therefore, beloved brothers, let us ascend without hesitation
to Holy Scripture through the praiseworthy commentaries of the
Fathers, as if on the ladder of Jacob's vision so that, lifted by
their thoughts, we may be worthy to arrive at contemplation of
the Lord.  For commentary on Scripture is, as it were, Jacob's
ladder, by which the angels ascend and descend (Gen. 28:12); on
which the Lord leans, stretching out his hand to those who are
weary, and supports the tired steps of those ascending by their
contemplation of Him. Therefore, we ought to keep this
arrangement of the readings, that after the recruits of Christ
have learned the Psalms, they may continuously practice the
reading of divine authority  until they understand the authority
thoroughly.  The books should be corrected to prevent scribal
errors from being fixed in untrained minds, because what is fixed
and rooted in the depths of memory is hard to remove. Happy
indeed is the mind that has stored such a mysterious treasure in
the depths of memory, with God's help; but much happier the mind
that knows the ways of understanding from its own energetic
investigation.  As a result, such a mind vigorously expels human
thoughts and is occupied to its salvation with divine eloquence. 
We recall that we have seen many men with powerful memories who,
asked about obscure passages, have solved the questions put to
them by examples drawn only from divine authority for a matter
stated obscurely in one place is set down more clearly in another
book.  An example of this is the Apostle Paul who to a large
extent in the letter written to the Hebrews elucidates the
writings of the Old Testament by their fulfillment in the time of
the New." (Cassidorus, *Institutiones*, Preface (trans. Halporn))

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion} 
Can you see textual evidence in the above passages of Cassidorus's tacit approval of the intellectual study of ancient/pagan culture and the scientific investigation of the natural world? (You could provide a response here or go above and annotate the quoted passage itself.)

{:.rquestion}
Consider for yourself: why might the study of things like astronomy, physics, grammar, logic, or rhetoric be important to a monk's study of Scripture?

</div>

Hopefully you can see in the above primary source some suggestions about the importance of preparatory learning for reaching the goal of a proper understanding of Scripture.

In the remainder of the *Institutions*, Cassiodorus advocates the importance of the 7 classical liberal arts in a monk's education. 

By Cassiodorus's time (after the writings of Boethius), the liberal arts were constituted in the following way:

•	Trivium (Logic, Grammar, Rhetoric)
•	Quadrivium (Astronomy, Geometry, Arithmetic, and Music)

This subject division will eventually become the basis of the medieval university curriculum.

Consider Book 2, Preface, para 1:

> "1. "Now it is time for us to go through the text of the
present book which has been arranged according **to the seven
divisions of secular letters**; and this number revolves constantly
as week succeeds week and stretches to the end of time. " (Cassidorus, *Institutiones*, Book 2, Preface, para 1 (trans. Halporn))

And again in Book 2, c. 3, para 19:

> "19.  We have surveyed the liberal arts, insofar as we have
judged them useful to beginners, to enable them to reach the
entrance of the disciplines through open doors as it were. 
Although it is difficult to enter and learn these disciplines,
the toil of the study of elements persists until one sees what
sweetness they have; but when scholars have reached the stage of
mature competence, each one regards it as delightful to have
endured the troubles of his endeavor.  We now turn to the
illustrious divisions of these arts in which Greece is correctly
thought to surpass the Latin language.  We will try not so much
to explain these briefly as to sketch them.  For why should what
is found clear and plain in the original authors be discussed as
it were more distinctively and fully?" (Cassidorus, *Institutiones*, Book 2, c. 3, para 19 (trans. Halporn))

Accordingly, one can see how Cassiodorus opens the door for monks to be eager and zealous to collect, preserve, and study the books of classical learning and to pass this learning on to others.

But in closing, we should be attentive to the inspiration behind Cassiodorus's sanctioning of secular learning. His awareness of his pilgrim status still colors how and why he thinks we should engage in this study. 

In contrast to the classical view that this knowledge should be pursued for its own sake, Cassiodorus sees pagan knowledge as having a utilitarian value. It is not to be studied for its own sake, but so that the Bible can be properly interpreted, and so that the pilgrim can be sure that they are correctly understanding the biblical road map to a heavenly destination. 

In this regard, the liberal arts are not actually liberal (freely chosen), but servile; they are not desirable for their own sake, but for the sake of something else.

Nevertheless, we ought to mark this tension as a central question for anyone who adopts the status of a pilgrim. Cassiodorus raises the question of the value of knowledge (specifically, secular or earthly knowledge) for the pilgrim. Is such knowledge valuable for a pilgrim? How much time should be devoted to it? Why is it valuable? And finally, what happens if it seems to contradict the biblical road map?

This is a tension that will only grow. It is a tension that Islam will struggle with as it matures, and it is a tension that Christianity will struggle with as Western Europe becomes increasingly cosmopolitan in the 12th century and the full corpus of Greek learning is rediscovered.

# Other Reflections

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
Our readings contain lots of other details about the history of monasticism that I was not able to touch on above. What other details in our readings struck you as interesting or important? Why? Please share via an annotation with the rest of the class.

</div>

# Key Takeaways

* Monasteries were seen as stores of spiritual power. Thus they were continually sought out by the earthly city and struggled to retain their independence.
* Reform is a continual activity within monasticism and the Middle Ages in general.
  * The history of monasticism offers us hints that the 16th century Protestant Reformation, rather than being a break with the Middle Ages, may actually be the fruit or even culmination of a thoroughly medieval impulse.
* As evidenced by Benedict and Cassiodorus, the pilgrim status puts one in an ambiguous relation with human knowledge. Monks were at once critics of worldly knowledge and essential to much of its preservation. This tension is captured in the subtly different attitudes of Benedict and Cassiodorus.

# What's Next

* It's time to turn to the East to the development of the Byzantine and Islamic Empires. 
* Here again we will see different interpretation of Pilgrim life and its political ramifications. 
* In Byzantine, we will look at the impact of the state Christian religion on maintaining an empire against numerous threats, internal and external. 
* In Islam, we will look first at the disruptive political challenge that a belief in the afterlife can pose to a society. 
* Secondly, we will see another example of the political challenges that emerge when trying to organize and sustain a pilgrim community in this earthly life.
