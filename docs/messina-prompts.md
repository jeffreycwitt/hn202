During the course of our semester, as part of our Messina program and our course participation grade, we are going to ask you to attend some campus wide lectures and/or events, and then collaboratively reflect on what you heard. 

We know you have different schedules that may conflict with some of these events, so we are asking you to go to two out of the three lectures events. For the lectures you attended, please use our class annotation tool to respond to one of the prompt questions AND reply to one post from a classmate.


# MLK Convocation (January 18th)

* Did this lecture have a central conclusion? What do you think that was? Can you reduce it to a couple of sentences?
  * With respect to this conclusion, can you identify any particular premises or supporting claims that you thought were especially critical? 
    * Was this premise well supported? How so?
    * Was this premise weak? How so?

* Was there anything introduced in this lecture that was new to you or made you think about something in a new way?
  * Was this claim or idea well supported? 
  * Did the speaker give you strong reasons to accept this new idea as true or valid? How so? 
  * Do you feel like the new idea, while provocative, needed more research or reflection before you were ready to accept it? How so?

# One Question Panel (March 29th)

* Prompts coming

# Vanishing Half Common Text Speaker Panel (Date TBD)
