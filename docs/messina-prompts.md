During the course of our semester, as part of our Messina program and our course participation grade, we are going to ask you to attend some campus wide lectures and/or events, and then collaboratively reflect on what you heard. 

We know you have different schedules that may conflict with some of these events, so we are asking you to go to two out of the three lectures events. For the lectures you attended, please use our class annotation tool to respond to one of the prompt questions AND reply to one post from a classmate.


# MLK Convocation (January 18th)

* Did this lecture have a central conclusion? What do you think that was? Can you reduce it to a couple of sentences?
  * With respect to this conclusion, can you identify any particular premises or supporting claims that you thought were especially critical? 
    * Was this premise well supported? How so?
    * Was this premise weak? How so?

* Was there anything introduced in this lecture that was new to you or made you think about something in a new way?
  * Was this claim or idea well supported? 
  * Did the speaker give you strong reasons to accept this new idea as true or valid? How so? 
  * Do you feel like the new idea, while provocative, needed more research or reflection before you were ready to accept it? How so?

# One Question Panel (March 29th)

* Consider the following questions and reflect on how the panel discussion affected your view on any of the following questions
  * There are conversations that exist about the word "inspirational" being applied to people with disabilities.  Some people with disabilities oppose that term for various reasons. What do you think some of those reasons might be?
  * Have you ever heard of the term "personal fable?" 
    * What does it mean?  
    * How does this term affect the way you perceive a sudden disability?
  * Do you know a person, or are you related to someone who has a disability? 
    * What have you learned from that person?  
  * How can using an asset-based approach when learning from and talking to people reframe the outcomes of conversations?

* How did your impression of the book change after hearing the author speak?
  * Did the author draw your attention to something that new that you hadn't noticed fore?
