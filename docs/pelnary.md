# Plenary 2 (Fri, Feb 02)
## Medieval Art - Dr. Boeye

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
Based on today's plenary what would be a good multiple choice quiz or exam question? Tell us why this would be a good question that captures a significant point raised in today's lecture.

{:.rquestion}
Based on today's lecture, can you think of anything that might be "distinctive" about medieval art? Something that separates it from other periods of art you are familiar with?

{:.rquestion}
It goes without saying that religion (or in this case Christianity and the Bible) frequently serves an inspiration for art. However, based on today's lecture can you think of a way medieval art is serving as an inspiration for how we understand religion (for example, how we understand the "pilgrim" Christian life or interpret the Bible)? (This is meant to be an open ended question, so feel free to answer in any way that feels right.)

{:.rquestion}
What other detail from today's lecture struck you as both strange **and** important? Tell us why, despite it strangeness, this detail might tell us something important the middle ages, medieval life, or medieval culture, etc.

# Plenary 3 (Fri, Feb 09)
## Medieval Monasticism - Dr. Bauerschmidt

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
As an exercise for thinking about our upcoming paper: does today's lecture point to any "essential characteristics" of medieval monasticism? In other words, what is a detail about medieval monasticism that you learned today that could be used to justify a object's inclusion in a corresponding exhibit? (E.g. This object needs ot be included because it points us to this "essential characteristic" of medieval monasticism.)

{:.rquestion}
Based on today's plenary, what would be a good multiple choice quiz or exam question? Tell us why this would be a good question that captures a significant point raised in today's lecture.
