{:.rquestion}
Based on today's plenary what would be a good multiple choice quiz or exam question? Tell us why this would be a good question that captures something significant and important about late antiquity

{:.rquestion}
Were there any details in today's plenary that connect to our discussion of the rise of monasticism? (E.g. how might a detail about the decline of Rome explains some of the attractiveness of Benedictine Monasticism?)
