## Glossing the Bible with Medieval Art  - Dr. Boeye

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
It goes without saying that religion (or in this case Christianity and the Bible) frequently serves an inspiration for art. However, based on today's lecture can you think of a way medieval art is serving as an inspiration for how we understand religion (for example, how we understand the "pilgrim" Christian life or interpret the Bible)? (This is meant to be an open ended question, so feel free to answer in any way that feels right.)

This object needs ot be included because it points us to this "essential characteristic" of medieval Islam.)
