# Introductory Note

We have a lot of history to cover today. What follows therefore will include lots of historical notes and bullet point lists. Please use these lists, combined with our reading, to develop your own narrative that you can think and walk through on your own. The goal of course is not that you can read and report someone else's notes, but that you yourself possess a sense of this narrative and could walk someone else through it. So after reading, step away from the class notes for a while and try to see if you can walk yourself (perhaps in your own notebook or talking to yourself aloud) through the main events. When you find places in your own account that are fuzzy, create an annotation and we can work through this places of un-clarity together. Likewise, if there are dates, events, or ideas that you think need to be added to our class narrative, please suggest them and tell us why they should be added using a "page annotation".

<!-- 
When we talked about the changes to the empire after 410, we noted the migration patterns of some important ethnic groups. At the same time, we also mentioned in passing the reaction of the Eastern Empire. 

{:.question}
What word did Rosenwein use as the title of this section (back in c. 1) to describe the reaction of the Eastern Empire?

{:.anwser}
"Retrenchment"

Instead of running to Rome to help ward of the invaders, the Eastern Empire built a massive wall to fortify their position. This is known as the Theodosian Wall (seen below guarding the west side of Constantinople)

<div class="image" markdown="1">

<span class="vda">Image Discuss Anchor</span>
</div>

This is the same Theodosian wall that plays an important role today's reading. 

We have also said a little about Byzantine's involvement in the west (Italy) during the 6th century.

We know that after Odavacer, Italy was claimed as part of the Ostragoth kingdom by Theodoric the Great at the end of the 5th century. 

But what happens next? What happens such that by 600 we see it labeled as the Kingdom of the Lombards? To what extent is Byzantium involved in this political transition? And finally, how does Byzantium develop and survive during the next two centuries? -->

# The development of Early Byzantium

Today, we want to the trace the historical narrative of the Early Medieval Byzantine Empire, while planting seeds for connections to the rise of Islam that we will begin next week and to the rise of the Carolingians that we will look at the following week. (This is a development to which chapter 2 of SHMA has already started to introduce us).

Historian Paul Freedman provides a useful break down of the developments within Byzantium that will be useful to frame our conversation. He breaks down the development as follows.

* 532-565 Justinian Expansion <!-- made a treaty with Persians in 540 -->
* 565-717 Contraction <!-- (loss of italy to Lombard, Sassanid Wars)(kind of dark age, not a lot sources, it is a militarized society)-->
* 717-843 Reconstruction <!-- (period of iconclasm) -->
* 843-1071 Expansion <!-- (Golden age, empire grew by 1/3) (see map of 1000), bulgars and slavs were converted  -->

## Justinian Expansion (532-565)

Without a doubt, the Emperor Justinian is a name we need to know. 

Justinian I, often called Justinian the Great (482-565), reigned from 527-565. 

Justinian did a lot of things both militarily and culturally. 

### Justinian Law Codes

His achievements include his development of an important collection of civil law that was used in the later Middle Ages in both the east and the west: The "Justinian Codex" and the "Justinian Digest". These "compendia" of laws codes became the backbone of medieval civil law in both the East and West.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion} 
Can you think of any reasons why this is such a remarkable cultural achievement? Why would creating this kind of compilation been extremely hard and requires hundreds, if not thousands of laborers? What would a legal research team have to do in order create these compilations? What might Roman Law have looked like prior to these compiled law codes?

</div>

### Iberian Wars with the Sasanians (527-532) and Perpetual Peace (532)

But in addition to major cultural achievements, Justinian also undertook several military campaigns and could point to many success.

A long time eastern foe of the Roman Empire was the Sassanid Dynasty of Persia. This conflict continued during the [Iberian Wars (526 to 532)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_War) but resolved in 532 with a new treaty of [Perpetual Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_Peace_(532)) between the Byzantines and Sasanians. While not "perpetual", it did provide for a period of peace that allowed Byzantium to expand its claims elsewhere.

### North African Campaign (533-534)

After negotiating peace with the Persians, Justinian captured North Africa from the Vandals in a relatively easy campaign (perhaps giving him false hope for other campaigns). (Recall that the Vandals were another migratory group that migrated south during the 5th century to occupy North Africa.)

### Italian Campaigns (535-540, 541-554)

Justinian, also tried to take back the Italian peninsula from the Ostragoths in two different campaigns from 535-540, and 541-554. 

And to do this he tried to enlist the help of mercenaries.

{:.question}
What group did he enlist to help with this campaign?

{:.answer}
The Lombards

But these campaigns went pretty poorly. And by the time they were done, Byzantine was so exhausted that the Lombards looked around at the territory they had occupied on behalf of the Byzantines and decided to simply claim the territory for themselves.


### New Justinian Wars with Sasanians Empire (540-562)

Part of this exhaustion is due to the fact that the peace with the Persians was breaking down, and Justinian was suddenly embroiled in further military campaigns in the east. Thus Justinian was forced to fight in the East at the same time he was fighting in the West.


### In Sum 

Rosenwein in SHMA, Map 1.8, p. 34 gives us a good picture of the still extensive boundaries of the Byzantine Empire in year 600.

But one has to wonder if this period of "Justinian Expansion" was another example of **imperial overreach**, which Paul Kennedy defines as: "the tendency of empires, in an attempt to protect themselves, to make themselves ever bigger and thus making them indefensible."

Justinian certainly had success, but when he died, this success quickly came undone.

## Contraction (565-717)

After the death of Justinian we start to see contraction.

* The first and most obvious example is in Italy, where the Lombards claimed the newly conquered Byzantine territories for themselves.
* Starting around 570, Avars (Mongol/Turkish people) (and their subordinates Slavs) gradually began migrating into the Balkans.
* Finally, Byzantium suffered serious losses to the Persians and then later serious losses to the rising Islamic empire until they finally stopped the Islamic advance in 717.

### The Siege of 626

It is within this period that our reading about the Siege of 626 takes place. So let's take the opportunity to a look a bit closer.

<!-- I don't want to belabor every detail of the Siege of Constantinople by I would like to use to get a sense of what Constantinople was like, the main players of this battle, and as our reading asks us to consider, the ways in which religion is melding with politics in the chronicle of this event.  -->

Leading up to the event: 

* Emperor Maurice (582-602) was murdered by his troops in 602, while campaigning against the Avars and Slavs in the Balkans. 
* Phocas becomes ruler in 602.

{:.question}
How did the Persian emperor (Chosroes react)? (See SHMA p. 42)

{:.answer}
"he took advantage of the ensuing political chaos to invade Byzantine territory. By 604 he had captured Dara....Damascus by 613...Jerusalem and Alexandria by 619." (SHMA, p. 42)

Compare these loses to the map in SHMA p. 35 of Byzantine Empire circa 600.

Phocas's reign, understandably, is considered a disaster by the Byzantines. And Phocas was overthrown in 610.

{:.question}
Who was his successor, mentioned briefly in the account of the siege? 

{:.answer}
Heraclius

And Heraclius (r. 610-641) "went on the offensive" (see SHMA, p. 42) against Persia. 

However, his offensive campaigns against the Persians opened up a weakness at home, and the Persians (who had allied with the Avers/Slavs) decided to attack Constantinople itself. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
What was this Siege like? What details struck you as interesting or noteworthy? Why? Can you point us to particular passages of interest?

{:.rquestion}
For example, who were the attackers? Where were they positioned? What strategies did they employ? How did the Byzantines defend themselves.

</div>

This was an amazing victory for the citizens of Constantinople who fought off something like 50,000 attackers with an army of approximately 10,000 people. 

Obviously, the Theodosian Wall, which figures prominently in the first hand account had a lot do with their success. Let's take a quick closer look at the wall and its role in the battle. 

Here is the map of Constantinople with important battle landmarks identified.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Let's step back from military details and consider some of the more abstract social and religious dimensions of this battle. 

{:.rquestion}
How did religion (Mary specifically) figure into the primary source accounts of the siege? Can you point us to some textual evidence in the assigned reading? 

<!-- Apparently, Patriarch Sergius paraded the icon of Mary on the wall each day. 

* The Icon of the Virgin Mary looms large and this is another signpost for us of a larger trend.
  * [text in reading], p. 59, very vague reference
    * http://www.sophiausyd.org/articles/the-history-behind-the-akathist-hymn-the-siege-of-constantinople-in-626
    * Apparently Patriarch Sergius paraded the icon on the walls each day.
    * Apparently, the walls were actually crowded with different images of Christ and other saints
-->

{:.rquestion}
Might these uses of the images of Mary be related to the later controversy between the iconophiles and iconoclastics? How so?

</div>

### After the Siege

At this point, we should summarize the state of the empire after these many wars. 

It is true that Heraclius recovered most of the cities lost by Phocas. But the condition of the empire had nevertheless significantly changed since the days of Justinian. Here are some bullet points.

* The re-conquered cities were exhausted, depleted, weak.
* The example of Ephesus in SHMA, 44-46 illustrates this transformation.
* When we consider the sweeping victories of the emerging Islam culture in the second half of the 7th century (starting around 650) and the early 8th century, surely the weakening strength of Byzantium and Persia (through their own fighting) helps us explain why the Arabs could conquer these regions with such success.
* The provinces also changing (SHMA, pp. 46-47)
  * > "With the disappearance of the traditional town councilors--the curiales--cities and their rural hinterlands were now controlled directly by the reigning imperial governor and the local "notables"--a new elite consisting of the bishop and big land-owners favored by the emperor" (SHMA, p. 46).
  * This is an important note as we turn to the reconstruction period, where we see the considerable influence and the involvement of the emperors, not just in the defense of the city, but in the religious and moral life of the empire. 
  * We see a little of this in the report from the Quinisext council 691/692 (How so? Can you point to any examples?) but also in the emergence of Iconoclasm. Iconoclasm is hard to fully explain without seeing it as a top down, emperor-driven movement.

### In sum

To summarize, we might ask: How does the siege of 626 event help us capture and explain several changes that would continue to be of importance? 

For my part, the battle is a pivotal point that helps me remember several different developments.

* It reminds me of the original "retrenchment" of Byzantine (particularly because of the importance of the Theodosian Wall).
* It reminds me of the ongoing battles with the Sasanians; a world shaping interaction that would last for several hundred years. 
* It reminds me of the period of contraction:
  * Consider the map of Byzantium in year 600 (SHMA, p. 35) and compare it to the map of Byzantium in year 700 (SHMA, p. 43).
  * But the contraction is not just about the reach of the empire but also about its vitality.
  * The cities retaken by Heraclius are exhausted and depleted.
  * The provincial middle class is significantly reduced and replaced by an emerging new imperial elite exercising local control.
* It also reminds me of what is coming. The siege of 626, will be followed by new sieges of Constantinople by Arab forces in 674 and 717.
* And as we will see Arab forces will re-capture much of the cities previously traded back and forth between Byzantium and Persia. 
  * And they will quickly take most of the Byzantium holdings around the Mediterranean, giving us the map in SHMA. p. 43 circa 700.
* It reminds us of changes in the Balkans, particularly the resettlement of the Bulgars, Avars, and Slavs.
  * Rosenwein writes: "the place where once the two halves of the Roman Empire had met was now a wedge--created by Bulgars Avars, and Slavs" (SHMA, p. 43; see map 2.2 in SHMA, p. 43). 
* Finally, the religiously infused myths/legends surrounding the defense of the city point toward the coming iconoclasm controversy. 
  
## Reconstruction (717-843)

Starting in the 8th century, things seem to be settling down a bit. We have some strong emperors and the Arab expansion slows. 

Part of this period of reconstruction includes the internal debates and conflicts arising from the debate over icons.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.dquestion}
First, what are religious icons? Have you seen any before? Where? Do you have a favorite? Can you find a good representative icon online somewhere and share it with the class via an annotation?

{:.answer}
Icons, are religious art often believed to be carrying spiritual or sacramental power. They are usually portable. They are usually non-narrative. 

</div>

<!-- But there are more nuanced arguments as well: 

{:.rquestion}
From our reading what was the particular concern with images of Christ?

Images of Christ confuse his two natures.

There are some serious theological controversies and heresies standing in the background here.
One of the central questions in Byzantium was about the divinity and humanity of Christ. Does Christ have one nature or two?

Monophysites believed he had one divine nature. However, in emphasizing his one divine nature would seem to downplay Christ's humanity.

Nestorians wanted to make sure his humanities was emphasized, so they insisted that he had two natures, one divine and one human.
But, if Christ had two natures, how did they relate to each other? Did Mary give birth to the human person (christostokos, Mary, "bearer of Christ"), while the separate divine person loosely united itself with human person Jesus for a time on earth. (Or did Mary give birth to the divine nature itself (theotokos, Mary, "bearer of God"). Nestorians suggested the latter leading others (like the Monphysites) to be concerned that they were downplaying his divinity.

The resolution at the Council of Calcedon in 451 was a particular formula designed to steer a middle position between both Nestorianism and Monophysitism. 

"Christ is one person (hypostasis) with two natures" -->

It is clear that by the 8th century divisions emerged over the theological legitimacy of icons. 

But it is an opening scholarly question of why the backlash against icons first emerged. 

As we have seen, there was clear predilection for these images in the 5th, 6th, and 7th centuries. We saw their use in the Seige of 626 and we can see them positively discussed in canon 82 of the Quintisext council, which calls for more explicit images of Christ. (See page 62 of our primary source reading).

But something happened to turn the tide.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.dquestion }
What does our textbook suggest are some reason for the rise of iconoclasm in the late 7th century and early 8th century (See SHMA p. 47)? Can you think of any other reasons for the disagreement?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

* It could be argued that they violate the commandment, "thou shall not make graven images".
* Leo III (r. 717-741) pushed the idea that the use of images were the cause of Byzantium's misfortune.  After a Volcano in 726, he denounced religious images publicly.
* It is also possible that he saw the success of Arab forces, and being aware of their disuse of images, concluded that Arab iconoclasm was a cosmic reason for their success.
* Our textbook also suggests that ruling elites may have seen icons and the spiritual power they possessed as a threat to their power and control.
  * Rosenwein writes: "religious elite are worried about losing control over the sacred" (SHMA, p. 48)

</div>
</div>

When Leo dies in 741 his Son, Emperor Constantine V (r. 741-775) follows the iconoclastic trend initiated by his father, but he takes it to another level. He used his imperial power to enforce and even persecute the iconophiles.  

For example: Emperor Constantine along with 300 bishops was present at the synod of Constantinople in 754 where the use of images was "banned outright" (SHMA, p. 48). He further tries to purge the army and bureaucracy of iconphiles. 

With Constantine's death, the ban abated, but there was a second iconoclastic period from 815-843.

From the perspective of history, these bans by and large advanced the cause of iconophilia. They had the unintended effect of motivating an industrious period of apologetics (defense) on behalf of icons. Icons in the east came to perform a similar role that "relics" in the west would play, and they continue to be an important characteristic of Greek Orthodoxy today.

### Expansion (843-1071)

After the period of Iconoclasm ended, Byzantium seemed to enjoy a particularly successful period from around 843 to 1071. 

But with eye toward where we are going, we might ask: 

{:.dquestion} 
Why do historians end this last period of expansion and golden age in the year 1071?

<div class="answer">
1071 was the Battle of Manzikert in which Seljuk Turks defeated Byzantine at Manzikert, initiating Turkish control over most of Anatolia. 

The Byzantine empire would live on largely through the survival of Constantinople, which would remain intact until 1453, when it fell, not to the Seljuk Turks, but to the Ottoman Turks.

</div>

# Key takeaways

* Our key goal today is to be able trace the development of Early Byzantium from roughly 500 to 1071.
* We've seen this period broken up into four periods each with their own distinctive characteristics.
* Make sure you can generally trace these events and explain what distinguishes these four different periods.

# What's Next

* Next we will turn to the rise of the Islam and the Islamic Empire which takes place during the same centuries as the development of  Early Byzantium.
* We will trace the key events in the rise of Islam and try to connect these events to what is going on in Byzantium and Persia at the same time.
