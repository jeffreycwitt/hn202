## Intro

This week (and the next) we're going to focus on the rise of the medieval universities and the intellectual tradition known as medieval scholasticism.

Next week we will focus on the text of Thomas of Aquinas and we will have a plenary entitled "The Rise of the Universities"

Today I want to use our assigned readings to really look at some of the preceding intellectual traditions and consider how the university tradition both emerged from that tradition and departed from it.

## Developing Intellectual Traditions

With the help of the article by Richard Southern, "the Tradition of Thought", let's look first as some of the influences that leads us to the medieval university which emerges in the 12th century for the first time.

### Monasticism
 
<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Consider Southern's discussion of monasticism starting around page 185.

{:.rquestion}
In what way, has Monasticism promoted the pursuit of scientific inquiry and for what purpose?

{:.dquestion}
Why was astronomy important? 

{:.answer}
p. 185, “But, in detail, much remained to be done, especially as the number of the saints’ days observed by special forms of service grew rapidly, and the taste for elaboration liturgical matters became more widely shared.”

{:.dquestion}
Why were mathematics important?

{:.answer}
composing hymns and antiphons, conducting daily business and commerce, keeping track of monastery finances, see p. 187

{:.dquestion}
Why was music important? 

{:.answer}
composing antiphons

{:.dquestion}
Why was history important? 

{:.answer}
justification of privileges, defend genuineness of holy relics, see p. 192. We saw the importance of this in our reading of Henry II, monastery and churches need to establish the precedent of privileges they enjoyed against rival claims. Writing histories, preserving institutional charters was a way of doing this.

</div>

At the same time, our reading emphasizes that while certainly encouraging learning in some respect, monasticism also halted its progress.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.dquestion}
How did Benedict’s rule both promote learning and halt its expansion? (Consider especially p. 190 from our reading.)

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

p. 188: “Each year at the beginning of Lent each monk took a book from the library to serve as his reading for the succeeding year.”

p. 190: “The growth of a scholastic theology in the monasteries would be unthinkable: the endless systemization and articulation of details could not have been carried out by men working in small communities, in the intervals of a full communal routine. …In so far as thought become urgent, all-absorbing and harassing, it was straying beyond the bounds of the Rule.”

### Florilegia

Richard Southern notes that monastic approach to study lead to a strange and unique kind of scholarly output, known as "Florilegia"

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.dquestion}
How did the Monastic approach to study lead us to the “florilegia”?

{:.answer}
p. 191: “The typical product of this private monastic study was the florilegium”

{:.rquestion}
What are the advantages and disadvantages of florilegia? In what ways do the advance or aid study? What is still missing?

{:.dquestion}
How does Richard Southern suggest that the practice of producing “florilegia” leads to the intellectual movement we call scholasticism, which lasts from the 12th to the 16th century? How is different from the learning "by story" discussed by Rosemann (see below)?

{:.answer}
p. 191: “The scholastic method was a development of the florilegium…” 

</div>

### Cathedral schools

Besides the role of education in the monasteries, there was also a growing trend to provide education to clergy, who were not monks, but who would go on to hold ecclesiastical offices or work in the rapidly expanding royal courts. 

These centers of training were known as cathedral schools (see p. 193 of the Richard Southern article).

{:.rquestion}
What exactly is a cathedral school? Did you get a sense from the reading?

It is important to recognize that other kinds of clerical fraternities developed in the middles ages besides monasteries.

A prime example of this, are the Cathedral Chapters or collegiate churches, so named because there was college or chapter of priests associated with the church.

The members of this chapter, were referred to as canons, and they were generally clerics responsible for running the services of the cathedral. But unlike monks they lived separately, maintained their own estates, but were, in theory, supposed to lead their lives according to a code of conduct set by the chapter. 

Notice that nothing in what I’ve said here says anything about education or schooling, so how do we get from cathedral chapters to cathedral schools? 

There are at least 6 important factors.

1) Charlemagne’s edict the [“Admonitio Generalis”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admonitio_generalis) in 789. 

In 789 Charlemagne, frustrated with the level learning he saw in his empire, required that every bishopric create a school where "children can learn to read; that psalms, notation, chant, computation, and grammar be taught." (Riché, "Daily life in the world of Charlemagne", 1988, p. 191.)

See also p. 194 of the Richard Southern article, “It is true that in the ambitious education projects…”

2) Gregorian reforms in 1050-1080, emphasizing a need for greater knowledge of canon law and sacraments would have also increased the need for function ecclesiastical schools that were not confined to the monasteries. 

3) Third Lateran council in 1179, pushed for further ecclesiastical discipline. 

Canon 18 in particular required every cathedral church to appoint a master to teach clerics and poor scholars.

The form that the execution of this command took was the development of a school attached to each cathedral.

4) Our emphasis last week on the growth of the secular court in the 11th and 12th centuries and the growing need for literate administrators would have also created urgency for the effective administration of cathedral schools.

5) Increased population swells in major cities in the 12th century.

See, Southern, p. 195, “the rise in the rapid growth in the floating population of students of all ages and conditions”

<!-- <div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.dquestion}
From our reading could you get a sense of the kind of interaction that occurred between private (paid) teachers and the cathedral schools? (Consider the discussion of Abelard on page 196.)

{:.answer}
p. 196, “…Abelard, could find audiences, and profitable ones, wherever he chose to teach. But the cathedrals provided a natural focus for the activities of such men.”
</div> -->

6) Loose governance of cathedral canons 

Consider Southern's notes pages. 193 and 197. Here he notes that members belonging to a cathedral chapter, (i.e. communities of secular clergy) were allowed space for independent study and research.

He writes: 

> p. 195, top: “Organically, the school had only a small place in the cathedral organization, but it could scarcely be omitted altogether” 

> p. 195: “The impulse which raised some of them to heights of scholarly repute came from a larger world than that of ecclesiastical routine. It came from the intellectual restlessness…”

> p. 197: “…The slendernesss of the connexion between the work of the schools and the life of the cathedral body. It was easy for the cathedral schools to start a life of their own…

## Story vs. System

Let's turn now to the article from Philipp Rosemann and think about how the above influences were leading to a new kind of intellectual approach.

Commentators and historians have sometimes remarked that the dominant mode of intellectual discourse prior to the 12th century was largely one of **narrative**; of story-telling with occasionally commentary; where narrative can be contrasted with systematic organization.

Think of the Bible. The Bible is a chronological story. The Bible has a lot to say about sin, but you won't find these discussions grouped together under one subject heading. It is a discussion that will be scattered throughout the story. To absorb this information, you have to absorb the story.

This is certainly the strategy of the Benedictines, who not only read and recite the biblical in a cyclical fashion, but also embody it through their prayer cycle and the celebration of the church calendar.

Besides the Bible, Christian discourse largely took place in commentaries on the bible, sermons inspired by the bible, or letters addressed to particular times and places within the chronological story of human history.

Think even of Augustine's *City of God*. It is an impressive work. But it is a meandering work. Written over 30 years, it tells the story of the city of man and the city of God, often responding to current events or the questions and concerns of readers. Augustine will have a lot to say about politics, but you won't find any definitive statement in a section titled "Politics". Instead, you will have to "glean" it as you harvest the story.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Given this older approach of instruction through story...

{:.rquestion}
What are some of the **advantages** of knowledge instruction through story? (Can you think of any contemporary examples?)

{:.rquestion}
What are some of the **disadvantages** of knowledge instruction through story?(Can you think of any contemporary examples?)

{:.rquestion}
What is an example of "systemization" that Rosemann points to? What kind of advantages does this approach offer?

</div>

There are of course real advantages to communicating a message via story. The message is easier to internalize; it is easier to remember; and it is easier to relate to as one connect with passion and fervor of plot and characters. 

But there are some disadvantages as well. Meaning and implications are difficult to control or codify. It is as slow and inefficient method for retrieving information. And perhaps importantly, because the message has to be gleaned from the story, it invites a range of interpretation, creating the potential for internal contradictions, inconsistencies, and controversy.

If the tendency of the Western Church in the 10th and 11th (as seen in the lead up to the first crusade) is moving increasingly toward centralized papal power and the unification and standardization of church practice across Europe, we can easily imagine how communication via "story" creates administrative difficulties. 

The need for “systematization” and “codification” becomes increasingly urgent in the 12th century, as uniformity in action and procedure become increasingly important.

For example, marriage is official declared a sacrament in the 12th century or yearly penance and Eucharistic participation is demanded at the Fourth Lateran council in 1215. This means that there is extra pressure and need for a large army of clerics capable and knowledgeable of how to perform these rites. 

The Bible might be a more interesting story, but there is no easy answer about how to quickly instruct a catechumen, preparing for baptism, about the correct formulation of trinity, or what to do if the priest performing doesn't do it quite right.

When baptism is seen as urgent matter of eternal life and death, uncertainty in this area will lead to massive administrative headaches; at the very least a flood of appeals for clarification and allowance, at worst schism and eventually conflict.


### Example of Abelard: Abelard, Identification of the Problem, and Development of a New Method

During class, we'll work through an example of Peter Abelard, and then, after I close, I will paste my notes here

<!-- Peter Abelard arrives in Paris in the 1102 and quickly finds himself standing in opposition to the old guard; a group of thinkers that feels **satisfied with the "story" method** and suggest that to pursue anything is a hubris and can only damage this message.

Following others, we can call these people the **anti-dialecticians**: the most famous representative is Bernard of Clairveaux, who really did not like Abelard. Peter King and Andrew Arlig describe Bernard vis-a-vis Abelard as follows: 

> "Bernard of Clairvaux and other anti-dialecticians seem to have thought that the meaning of a proposition of the faith, to the extent that it can be grasped, is plain; beyond that plain meaning, there is nothing we can grasp at all, in which case reason is clearly no help. That is, the anti-dialecticians were semantic realists about the (plain) meaning of (religious) sentences. " (King, Peter and Andrew Arlig, "Peter Abelard", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2018 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/abelard/>.)

Abelard disagrees; he believes that there is no plain meaning to the text and that **reason** must always play a limited but important interpretative role in order to access the true message of faith.

This commitment doesn't just place him opposition with Bernard, but it **incentivizes** him to identify apparent conflicts and inconsistencies in the received stories that can only be solved by a kind of **systematization** of the message. For Abelard, apparent conflicts must be seen before they can be reconciled: this process is known as "dialectic" (hence Bernard's status as a member of the "anti-dialecticians")

Again King and Arlig write: 

> "Abelard has no patience for the semantic realism that underlies the sophisticated anti-dialectical position. Rather than argue against it explicitly, he tries to undermine it. From his commentaries on scripture and dogma to his works of speculative theology, Abelard is first and foremost concerned to show how religious claims can be understood, and in particular how the application of dialectical methods can clarify and illuminate propositions of the faith. Furthermore, he rejects the claim that there is a plain meaning to be grasped." (King, Peter and Andrew Arlig, "Peter Abelard", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2018 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/abelard/>.)


#### *Sic et Non*

The clearest example of this process of dialectic is Abelard's work known as *Sic et Non*, which illustrates, Abelard's purposeful pursuit of conflict, in order to bring about a higher resolution. The work also serves a prototypical example of the "Scholastic Method" which will dominate university education for the next 500 years.

*Sic et Non* is Latin for *Yes and No*. This title, while seemingly cryptic, perfectly captures Abelard's intentions. 

Instead of preceding by story or chronology, Abelard create a work **organized around topics**, more precisely questions, and then loosely groups those questions together around a broader topic.

The text itself contains 158 questions ranging from questions about the Faith and Reason, the Trinity, whether God knows everything, whether all the apostles are equal, how baptism should be performed, the nature of sin, etc. 

From an efficiency standpoint, one can quickly see the advantages of this approach. If you want to know how baptism should performed you can pick up a big book by Augustine and begin reading in hopes that you'll find something. Or you a can jump to questions 106 to 112 in Abelard's Sic and Non and be sure to find something helpful. 

But what will you find there? If you were hoping to find Abelard's answer to the question, you will be disappointed. 

You will actually find no original writing here, but rather a careful expert curation of quotations (in the manner of a "florilegia") that were scattered through the extensive "story-focused" works of the Church Fathers. With his team of researchers Abelard scoured the preceding gangly and unwieldy theological tradition, and carefully selected quotations from church authorities that respond to the stated question.

But to prove his point to Bernard, the selections he chose were carefully selected to prove his point: there is no plain meaning to the text; without reflection these theological authorities appear to contradict and conflict with one another. And thus, we can see the reason for his title "Sic et Non", that is "yes and no". Abelard curated separate citations from respected church theologians that could be used to support both a yes and no answer to the stated question.

Abelard's lack of originality here and instead deference to the Church Fathers, should be seen as part of his opposition to another extreme group; the so-called "pseudo-dialecticians" who see reason alone as the touchstone of truth.

Abelard's purposeful juxtaposition of bible verses and church authorities is NOT intended to undermine faith or suggest that reason should replace. Instead, the initial conflict is invitation for the assistance of reason to help us see through the lens of faith more clearly.

Another way to think of this might be to imagine a room with a window placed in a wall to high from which to see. 

On the floor is a deconstructed ladder strewn in pieces. The pieces of the ladder represent the pieces of revelation and church authority that reason alone could never fathom. Contra the Pseudo-Dialecticians, who refuse to engage with the pieces on the floor, no amount of intellectual effort will allow them to reach the window. But contra Bernard, with the engagement of reason, the pieces on the floor will never be able to serve as a ladder. Abelard's dialectic is precisely this process of re-assembly; figuring out how to put the different pieces of the ladder together; and eventually with enough refinement one can climb the ladder of faith and see clear.

"Sic et Non" then is Abelard's presentation of these pieces of the ladder and in the Prologue to this work, he invites his students to use the tools of dialectic to put the pieces back together. 

King and Arlig summarize his instructions:

Abelard offers advice in the Prologue for resolving the apparent contradictions among the authorities using a variety of techniques: see whether the words are used in the same sense on both sides; draw relevant distinctions to resolve the issue; look at the context of the citation; make sure that an author is speaking in his own voice rather than merely reporting or paraphrasing someone else’s position; and so on.  

Or we can look at Abelard's own words in the Prologue to Sic et Non

> (1-11) "When, in such a quantity of words, some of the writings of the saints seem not only to differ from, but even to contradict, each other, one should not rashly pass judgement concerning those by whom the world itself is to be judged, as it is written: "The saints shall judge nations" (cf. Wisdom 3: 7-8), and again "You also shall sit as judging" (cf. Matthew 19:28). Let us not presume to declare them liars or condemn them as mistaken – those people of whom the Lord said "He who hears you, hears me; and he who rejects you, rejects me" (Luke 10:16). Thus with our weakness in mind, let us believe that we lack felicity in understanding rather than that they lack felicity in writing –- those of whom the Truth Himself said: "For it is not you who are speaking, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks through you" (Matthew 10:20). So, since the Spirit through which these things were written and spoken and revealed to the writers is itself absent from us, why should it be surprising if we should also lack an understanding of these same things?"
 
> (330-350) "With these prefatory words, it seems right ,as we have undertaken to collect the diverse sayings of the Holy Fathers, which stand out in our memory to some extent due to their apparent disagreement as they focus on an issue; this may lure the weaker readers to the greatest exercise of seeking the truth, and may render them sharper readers because of the investigation. Indeed this first key of wisdom is defined, of course, as assiduous or frequent questioning. Aristotle, the most clear-sighted philosopher of all, advised his students, in his preface 'Ad Aliquid', to embrace this questioning with complete willingness, saying (cited by Boethius, In Categorias Aristotelis, ii): "Perhaps it is difficult to clarify things of this type with confidence unless they are dealt with often and in detail. However, it would not be useless to have some doubts concerning individual points." And indeed, through doubting we come to questioning and through questions we perceive the truth." -->
