# Intro and Review 

As Rosenwein noted in (SHMA, p. 315) Joan of Arc was a key figure in France's recovery and defeat of the English in the Hundred Years' war. She also hinted at a medieval phenomenon that we have not yet looked closely at. 

Rosenwein attributes some of the influence wielded by Joan of Arc to the fact that she was an: 

> "inheritor of the moral capital that had been earned by the Beguines and other women mystics." (SHMA, p. 315)

The hint here is to a mystical tradition that is identifiable and traceable, but it is also organic and fluid and therefore difficult to institutionalize. This "outsider" status also helps explains why we find several important women writers working within this tradition. They were, of course, barred from participating in traditional institutions (e.g. the universities), thus it was natural that they would find other venues. Here was a tradition that they could participate in and even gain prestige and clout. 

Some of the most famous of these women include:

* Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179)
* Marguerite Porete (1250-1310)
* Julian of Norwich (1342-after 1416)
* Catherine of Siena (1347-1380)
* Margery Kempe (circa 1373-after 1439)

There is a wide diversity within the mystical tradition, but one common characteristic that I would like to emphasize (given where we are going) is the inclination of the "Mystical" tradition to privilege experience (or experiential knowledge) over deductive or inferential knowledge.

For example, a bible verse frequently appealed to by mystical writers is Psalm 34:8: "Taste and see that the Lord is good". 

This verse is interpreted as an injunction to progress toward an even higher knowledge of God than what reason or rational inference can reach. The injunction is to acquire a kind of knowledge that is analogous to our physical senses, that is to "experience" God with our spiritual senses.

This is what I would like us to look for in Julian's writing; namely, the notion that a kind of intellectual experience is possible that can take us further than the method of rational argumentation that dominated the medieval universities and the "Scholastics".

# Julian and her *Revelations*

Let's start with Julian's basic bio.

She was born circa 1342 and died circa 1416. She was an anchoress of an English convent in Norwich who devoted her life to solitary living and prayer. She would have passed most of her life in a small cell attached to the church of St. Julian in Conisford at Norwich. While living primarily in isolation, she would nevertheless serve as a kind of counselor to those who came to speak to her from outside her cell. Margerie Kempe, another famous woman mystic, was one such visitor. 

On May 13, 1373, when Julian was 30 1/2 years old, she states that she began having revelations from the God. The content of these revelations and her exposition of them constitutes her text *Showings*, from which our reading today is excerpted.

*Showings* is actually a composite of two parts: a "short text" and something called the "long text".

The "short text" was presumably written shortly after receiving her revelations. However, a key aspect of these revelations for Julian was their difficulty. Many aspects of what was revealed to her was perplexing and hard to reconcile with other beliefs. She tells us repeatedly that she struggled to understand the meaning of these revelations. The long text, in contrast, records her process of beginning to a make sense of what was revealed and recorded in the short text. The long text was completed around 1393.

# Close Reading of Revelation 14, Chapter forty-one (pp. 248-250).

It cannot be denied that mystical writing is difficult to read. Its form flows and meanders. It can be ecstatic, excessively descriptive, or some variation of stream of conscious.

I'd like to face this challenge by looking closely for a "structure" in Revelation 14, chapter forty one (the first chapter of Revelation 14).

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Please read this chapter slowly. (Think through these questions before reading further.)

{:.rquestion}
What are the main assertions? 

{:.rquestion}
What are the sub-points? How does it all work together?

{:.rquestion}
When you think you have the main points covered, step back and ask yourself: What are some of Julian’s main concerns in this passage? 

{:.rquestion}
What general problem does she seem to be focused on? 

{:.rquestion}
How does the revelation and her exposition of that revelation solve or address this problem?

</div>

<!-- 1) Problem of incomplete trust affecting prayer

1) Solution through revelation (“I am the ground of your beseeching”, “1) if you beseech…2) how could it be?)

Breakdown of revelation

1)	If you beseech: he reminds of the goodness of God
2)	How could it not be: how shows the impossibility of not receiving an answer. 
3)	“I am the foundation”: “Our beseeching is not the cause of the goodness and grace which he gives us, but his own goodness” (P. 249)
a.	How does this resolve the original dilemma (I can pray even if I feel unworthy to pray)

Exposition on Beseeching: 

Because of the nature of “beseeching” as the divinely supported enduring will, it will be accepted and will be pleasing even if it doesn’t seem so.

Thanksgiving also belongs to prayer. Through beseeching God’s good nature become better known for which we can give thanks.  -->

In sum: What I see in this passage is a unique concern to create an alternative impression of God in the minds of her readers. The new image she is offering also helps us get a sense of the popular or dominant image of God that would seem to surround her: an image of God that **deters people from prayer** and frequently makes **God seem unapproachable**, an image of God who is **angry** and **wrathful**.

As we go forward, it will help us to step back a bit and consider why God (perhaps especially in thr 14th century) might have been seen as **angry** or **wrathful**. Then we can look at few further passages from Julian's 14th revelation and consider how she opposes this traditional view.

# Medieval Theodicies

## Manicheans and the Cathars

A Theodicy is a defense of God given in response to the "Problem of Evil". The Problem of Evil has a long history in the Middle Ages and various solutions have been proposed. 

The Problem of Evil is generally formed from three premises.

* God is good 
* God is all powerful 
* Evil exists

The problem states that any two of these premises can be consistently held, but all three cannot be true at the same time.

An early solution was proposed by a group called the Manicheans, made famous by Augustine’s own flirtation with the group and then rejection and opposition. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.dquestion}

From your reading of the *Confessions*, do you recall how the Manicheans attempted to resolve the problem of Evil? Which of the above two premises did they cling to? Which premises did they let go?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

Basically, they take evil, pain, and suffering very seriously. 

Evil is here and it is real. 

But this creates a problem?

How could an all-powerful, good God create evil?

To reconcile the presence of evil with their belief in God’s goodness they gave up on the idea of divine omnipotence.

Instead of saying God was omnipotent, they posited a second divine being, the evil God, who was responsible for creating the evil in the world.

</div>
</div>

It is important for us to recognize that this position has a staying power in the Middle Ages and a version of it was revived in a 11-14th century movement in Southern Europe by a group known as the [Cathars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism). The Cathars were eventually persecuted by the Church as a heretical sect, but the point is that the Manichean solution to the problem of evil was an attractive worldview.

## Augustine’s Response and Julian’s Basic Agreement

Long before Julian, Augustine rejected the view of the Manicheans, and in doing so, he established the dominant Christian paradigm for responding to the problem of evil.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
From your reading of the *Confessions*, do you call Augustine's response?

Here are few helping quotations.

> "Therefore, whatsoever is, is good. Evil, then, the origin of which I had been seeking, has no substance at all; for if it were a substance, it would be good." (Augustine, *Confessions*) <!-- See Baker, p. 65 -->

Here's a similar statement from another important Patristic author who holds the same view:

> So, then, evil has no being nor does it inhere in the things that have being. There is no place for evil as such and its origin is due to a defect rather than to capacity." (Ps-Dionysius)  <!-- (See Baker, p. 65) -->

{:.rquestion}
How do these quotations suggest Augustine would respond to the problem of evil? Which of the two premises does he hold on to? Which one does he let go?

</div>

In sum: The position here is that evil is not a "positive thing" that is created and therefore demands a creator. 

Thus "evil" is an "absence of the good", a "privation of the good."

In this respect, Julian is basically in agreement. Showing a remarkable familiarity with the Christian intellectual tradition, despite be barred from most of its intellectual institutions, she writes in Revelation 13:

> "But I did not see sin, for I believe that it has no kind of substance..." (Revelation 13, c. 27, p. 225). <!-- ll. 404-406 -->

# Accounting for the "privation"

But while Julian follows Augustine and the wider medieval church in protecting God from being the "creator" of evil, no one can deny that the privation of the good still has painful effects. And the question remains: why would God allow there to be a privation of the good when he knows that it can cause so much pain. 

Why allow this pain and sorrow to continue?

The typical answer lies in insisting on dual perspectives when it comes to the privation of the Good. 

From the Human Perspective it may seem like a flaw, but from the divine perspective it may actually be good, right, or fitting, or part of a proper "order".

Again, Julian seems to follow Augustine and the larger tradition here as well.

> "...For a man regards some deeds as well done and some as evil" (Revelation 3, chapter 11, p. 198) <!-- (see Baker, p. 66)) -->

But where she seems to be uncomfortable is in the explanation of why this pain and suffering is considered "right" or "fitting".

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

I think we can see this conflict emerging pretty well in 14.45-46 (pp. 256-259). Please look at this passage and chapter closely and then consider the following questions.

{:.rquestion}
What is the traditional church explanation for why pain and suffering is good, right, or fitting? 

{:.rquestion}
Why does Julian feel confused or uncomfortable with this traditional/Church answer?

</div>

In the end, she seems to be struggling with two portraits of God (and our relationship to him). 

On the one hand, there is the portrait of God in which there is no anger and no wrath. 

On the other hand, there is the portrait seen in the "common teaching" where God is an angry punisher of sin. 

# Augustine and the Juridical Response

The common teaching offers a fairly straight forward explanation for pain and suffering; this is a theodicy sometimes called the "Juridical Paradigm". In this paradigm, pain and suffering are allowed by God because humans have sinned an angered God. God therefore is justified in dolling out a wrathful punishment to correct the wrong. 

Augustine here is a good representative. In his *Unfinished Commentary on Genesis*, he says: 

> "whatever is called evil is either sin or **punishment of sin**"
<!-- (See Baker, p. 67) -->

In this case, evil (the privation of good) and all its painful effects enter the world because God thought it was good for humans to make free choices. Accordingly, it was good that they should be punished when human being use that free will poorly. 

Every sin is an affront to the balance of the universe and justice.

Punishment (most often experienced as pain and sorrow) must therefore be meted out by God in order to restore that balance.

And even though this might appear painful and evil, from the divine perspective, this is considered good because it amounts to restoring the balance of justice. 

In other words, punishment is a necessary (and good) part of an ordered world. Without it, the world would be un-ordered and less good. 

Thus, you can see why this is called the "Juridical Paradigm". It is characterized by a "looking-back" perspective. It saves God from doing anything evil or bad by "looking back" to the origin or responsible party for sin. It then acknowledges the need for restoration in the form of retribution for that past action. God’s wrath, anger, and vengeance are a good and necessary part of this restoration.

# Julian “Teleological Theodicy”

However, as we saw in 14.45, Julian is uncomfortable with this. Her revelations reveal to her a God with whom wrath and anger are fundamentally incompatible. 

To this, we could also add that Julian worries about what this picture of God might do to the everyday average Christian. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.dquestion}
How might this picture of God affect everyday Christians?

<div class="answer" markdown="1">
Baker writes: 

> “...Julian fears that her fellow Christians will be overwhelmed by their guilt for sin and their dread of a wrathful God. She writes to comfort those who are, like herself, vexed by a sense of personal sinfulness that conflicts with their belief in God’s all-encompassing love” (Baker, p. 68)

</div>

</div>

I think we already saw a bit of this concern in  14.41 (p. 248).

From the Juridical Paradigm, every pain, every instance of suffering, must therefore be interpreted as an indication of sin or wrong doing. In a world where suffering is pervasive (think of the 14th century plague), we can imagine that this view would have a dramatic psychological effect.

Another detail that may br important here is to note the considerable impact that the decision about penitence made at the fourth Lateran Council (1215) had on the minds of everyday pilgrims. 

The 4th Lateran council required confession at least once a year, creating an entire economic industry around the idea of introspection, confession, and penance. One effect of this was to shape people’s self-perception of themselves as bad, and even unlovable sinners, in a powerful way.

And thus, this solution of explaining away sorrow and pain as punishment and retribution is problematic.

She must therefore find a new way to explain why God allows sorrow and pain in the world. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
From your reading, did you get any sense of an alternate explanation for why God allows both sin and pain in the world. 

Consider the following passage in particular from chapter 48 (p. 263):

> "the blessed love which we shall know in God, which we might never have known without woe preceding it" (Revelation 14, c. 48, p. 263).

{:.rquestion}
How does this quotation connect to where we started, namely the idea that there is an experiential way of knowing God that is beyond rational argumentation?

{:.rquestion}
Why might the experience of "woe" be necessary for this kind of knowledge? Can you think of a examples where "woe" (suffering or pain) might be necessary to gain a certain kind of knowledge, a knowledge that could not be acquired by any other means?

</div>

In contrast to the "Juridical Paradigm", one scholar calls Julian's view the "Teleological Paradigm"

It is "Teleological" because it looks **forward** toward the result of pain and suffering, and Julian sees a result emerging from sin and suffering that is better than if the sin and suffering had never occurred. 

In the respect, Julian's most famous passage from Revelation 13 are highly relevant. Here she writes:

> "Sin is necessary but all will be well, and all will be well, and every kind of thing will be well." (Revelation 13, chapter 27, p. 225).

And a little later:

> "And it seems to me that this pain is something for a time, for it purges and **makes us know ourselves**..." (Revelation 13, chapter 27, p. 225).

<!-- See also 13.39 (p. 244-245; translation). -->

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.dquestion}
If we look back at chapter 41 and the discussion of prayer, is there any sense in which the suffering caused by the lack of desire to pray, the "dryness" of prayer, is actually leading to new and greater knowledge?

{:.answer}
By feeling ineffectual in prayer and understanding that God still hears our prayer, we understand God’s goodness, love, and graciousness in a deeper way.

</div>

In sum: here again we can see something typical or characteristic of the mystical tradition, namely the belief that there is a special kind of knowledge "through experience" that cannot be achieved through the rational deductive methods of the schools. 

For example, Aquinas may conclude that God is loving and therefore he "knows" this, but Julian and the mystical tradition are at pains to point out that "knowing" God's love through the experience of it is very different than being able to acknowledge the abstract fact.

The necessity of sin and suffering for this kind of knowledge is expressed in a few key places: 

> "...for we need to fall, and we need to see it; for if we did not fall, we should not know how feeble and how wretched we are in ourselves, nor, too, should we know so completely the wonderful love of our creator...." (Revelation 14, chapter 61, p. 300).

> "...and by the experience of this falling we shall have a great and marvellous knowledge of love in God without end..." (Revelation 14, chapter 61, p. 300).

On the teleological view, sin and retribution are not just accidental by products of our free will (as they are in the "juridical view"), they are necessary for a purpose (a "telos"). And in this way, Julian attempts to free the everyday Christian from excessive self-contempt at the thought of their own failings.

<!-- As we think about the rest of Revelation 14 and particularly the parable of the Lord and the Servant, I’d like you to keep this idea of the “teleological paradigm” in mind and see if you can find other examples of it or deeper explanations of why “sin” or “suffering” might be considered “necessary” and “lovely”.  -->

# The Parable of the Lord and Servant

Finally, that Julian is aware that her "teleological paradigm" opposes the classical and traditional paradigm can be seen clearly in her account of the "Parable of the Lord and Servant".

Despite her presenting this as a revelation, her story of the Lord and Servant is similar to the story given by Anselm (11th century), who is attempting to illustrate and explain the classical "juridical paradigm". 

Let's look at Anselm's account first and then compare the two accounts.

Anselm's story is short and reads as follows: 

> "Indeed, if the origin of his inability were not in himself, there
might be some excuse for him. But if in this very impotence lies the
fault, as it does not lessen the sin, neither does it excuse him from
paying what is due. Suppose one should assign his slave a certain
piece of work, and should command him not to throw himself into a
ditch, which he points out to him and from which he could not
extricate himself; and suppose that the slave, despising his master’s
command and warning, throws himself into the ditch before pointed
out, so as to be utterly unable to accomplish the work assigned; think
you that his inability will at all excuse him for not doing his appointed
work?" (Cur Deus Homo, 1.24; Works of St. Anselm, tr. by Sidney
Norton Deane, [1903])


<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Now look closely at Julian's account of the "Lord and the Servant" in chapter 51 (pp. 267-278).

{:.rquestion}
How do the two accounts compare? 

{:.rquestion}
Why are Julian’s revelations conflicting with Anselm's story?

{:.rquestion}
In what way does Julian's version of the Parable of the Lord and Servant illustrate her "teleological" explanation of pain and suffering?

# Key Takeaways

* We focused on Julian of Norwich as a representative of the mystical tradition.
* Within her writings and revelations, we saw her concern for creating an image of God that was approachable and loving as opposed to a view of God as wrathful and angry.
* This reversal was most clearly seen in her answer to the problem of evil.
  * Here we discussed a traditional Christian answer to the problem of evil in the form of the "Juridical Paradigm".
  * And we saw Julian's alternative answer in the form of the "Teleological Paradigm".
* The "Teleological Paradigm" and its focus on knowledge through **necessary experience** gave us a chance to highlight a distinguishing characteristics of the mystical tradition: namely, that experiential knowledge supersedes knowledge acquired through argument and deduction.
