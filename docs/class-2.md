# Review / And historical overview. 

Let's start with a little bit of review. 

TODO: add some general review material

{:.dquestion}
First, why does Rosenwein talk about the "Provincialization of the Empire" as coinciding with the crisis of the third century. 

{:.answer}

> p. 4: "To contend with attacks, the Romans responded with wide-ranging reforms that brought new prominence to the provinces"

{:.question}
How so?

{:.answer}
	Provinces were "fortified", p. 4

Most importantly, attacking groups were actually were absorbed and turn into fighting units, in return for land, strengthening their position within the borders of the empire. 

And to support military campaigns, tax money from across the empire was being re-distributed to these provincial regions.

This military strength helps explain the succession crises of the third century as many of the emperors appearing in the 3rd century were "barracks emperor". Empires that rose through the ranks of the army, one the allegiance of their troops, and used that strength to declare themselves emperor. 

{:.question}
Who first credited with bringing this crisis under control? 

{:.answer}
Diocletian (244-311), becomes an emperor, as another "barracks emperor" rising as military leader, rather and taking power by force, rather than rising through the aristocratic class. Diocletian is thought to have brought the crisis under control by instituting some important reforms.

{:.question}
Question: What's one important reform Rosenwein notes? 

{:.answer}
One of his most important from the standpoint of the middle ages, was the development of the Tetrarchy (293-313) which divided the empire into two halves, and the two halves again, thus into four distinct pieces each with a different ruler, which was meant to help support the governance of the sprawling land mass.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">
Question: Any ideas why this might be important going forward. 

The split was harbinger of things to come. 

For example: 

Constantine reunited the emperor under one ruler (but importantly moved the capital to Byzantium, later Constantinople in 330). 

But in 395, Theodosius I, concerned about the inheritance of sons, used the pattern of east / west division seen in Diocletian, to appoint both his sons emperors, one over the western part and one over the eastern part.
</div>

[cut] Question: There was another important aspect of Diocletian reforms. This was the Diocletian persecution of Christians. And it played a role in one of the first schisms between the church, particularly relevant to Augustine's life and work. 

During the persecution, many Christians went underground and hid their faith. Others boldly declared their faith, and were routinely martyred. 

Upon the end of the persectuiong under (whom? Constantine), those who went underground, re-surfaced. Those who had faced the persecution head on, called the Donatists, somewhat justiably, felt that this previously members were apostate because of their cowardess, and should not be considered members of the church.

Much of Augustine writing has to do with, reconciling the two parties and unifying a catholic church. (or universal) church.

Ok, just a couple more events, 

* 303 persecutory edict in 303 (Diocletian)
* 311 Edict of Serdica (Sofia, Bulgaria) (edict of toleration) 311 (Galerius)
* 313 Edict of Milan 313 (Constantine) 
* 378 in 378, the visigoths rebel and kill emperor Valens, 
* 380 in 380, the edict of thessalonica declares Xn as a state religion. 
* 410 and in 410, must importantly, what happens, Alaric and the visigoths sack Rome, a the very least a symbolic form of Rome's glory and power. 

All of these events lead us to a narrative or accusation that is the central focus of our reading. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Question: What is that accusation? 

That the decline of Rome's military might and worldly prosperity go hand in hand with the rise of Christianity and its recognition as a state religion.

"Pluvia defit, causa christiani"

Augustine's City of God, whose full title, is City of God, against the Pagans, is therefore a kind of Apology. It was begun after the sack of Rome in 410 and something he worked on for much of the rest of his life. 

</div>

# Strategies for Challenging the Roman Narrative 

I see this this chapter, in general, as a fantastic encapsulation of Augustine's answer (or better answers) to these charges. Basically, his response to the accusation of the Pagans against the Christians. 

Reading through Augustine’s response in chapter can be a bit confusing or a feel a bit chaotic. Augustine writes in literary, rhetorical, and meandering style. He is often sarcastic or asks rhetorical questions. 

So, we need to go slowly here and try to dis-entangle and then reconstruct the separate arguments he introduces. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1"> 

Question: So, what general strategies do you see at work in his response in chapter 2?

</div>

I want to focus in on two strategies that I think dominate Augustine’s response.

1)	First, he can admit the decline, but argue against the correlation with Xn.  (cc. 1-17 seem to fit this strategy.

2)	Second, he can deny the existence of such a decline at all by denying the assumption that Rome was once doing well,


## Admit Decline, but Deny Correlation. (cc. 1-17)

The general tenor of this strategy is that Rome really has declined in terms of its moral integrity and self-discipline, but this happened long before Christianity ascended in Rome. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">
Question: What evidence does he offer for this?

* See Selections from chapter 1-17
* See "modus tollens" argument at end of chapter 13

</div>

## Argument against decline.

The second strategy is to argue that the perception of a decline is itself an illusion, because the perception of a golden era of "doing well", of "thriving" is also an illusion.

There are two sub-strategies here that I think align with two different eras in Rome’s history that could be seen as "prosperous"

1) the early but pre-christian empire that was famous for being militarily strong and materially prosperous. 

2) and the mythical Roman Republic, famous for its self-discipline and justice.

### First sub-strategy

Let’s start with the first sub-strategy

The notion that a society is in “decline” or “ascendency” relies on some fundamental assumptions?

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

<span class="respond"/> What kind of beliefs are already assumed in such an assessment?

</div>

Fundamentally, it relies on a definition of what it means to be doing well, to be successful, and to be happy, both at an individual and social level. Conversely, it demands an understanding of what it means to be doing poorly. 

Augustine recognizes precisely this, and thus his goal is not merely to argue that Christianity is not the cause of the decline, or even directly to argue that there is no decline, but to radically challenge Roman definitions of what it means to be doing well.

Once this definition of the good is altered, he can argue that Rome never really was doing well (even Roman in its most materially prosperous state) and therefore there really has been no decline.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

So, in the argument that Christianity is the cause of decline from the time of the early empire, what kind of metric of the good is generally being used?

<span class="response"/>Can we find some places where Augustine identifies conceptions of flourishing held be the Romans?

Look especially at chapter 20

<span class="respond"/> What conception of success/happiness is described in chapter 20.

<span class="respond"/>Is this conception of happiness relatable?

<!-- Increased GDP, no one complains, everyone’s employed.
Sounds eerily contemporary.
Housing bubble before 2008
Big Short (the movie), no one asks any questions about fundamentals while things “appear” to be doing well. -->

<span class="respond"/> Why does Augustine reject this as genuine definition?

<!-- Augustine clearly sees this as a profligate existence. For him this is an obviously unsustainable and directionless definition of doing well that can never last and will always contain within it the seeds of its decline. 

In other words, this kind of life is already in decline, it's form has simply not yet transformed into the horror that it is. 

As a side note: When we read Dante’s purgatory at the end of this semester (there is going to be the image of a siren calling Dante away from moral progress up Mount Purgatory. The image is much the same as this, a beautiful mirage calls us in one direction, but when finally possessed, it reveals itself to be a horrible nightmare. -->
</div>

### Second sub-strategy

Objection: With this first response in mind, an objection is possible which Augustine recognizes at the beginning of chapter 21 and elsewhere in the chapter

{:.question}
What is this objection?

{:.answer}
The objection is something like. The Rome described above is not the true Rome. The true Rome is the Rome of the Republic.

The objection suggests that there was a different Rome: a Rome that would be just as horrified by this indulgent definition of happiness as Augustine is.

This is the Rome of the Republic where virtue and self-restraint ruled, and thus there really has been a decline.

And thus, the objector might say, maybe the rise of Christianity still correlates with the loss of civic virtue and social justice.


How can Augustine respond to this?

I think he can respond in a couple of ways.

First, he can repeat his first strategy of acknowledging the decline but can deny the correlation with the rise of Christianity.

> p. 60: “…what will they make of Cicero’s statement, that even in his time it had become entirely extinct and there remained extant no Roman republic at all.”

The Roman empire, after all, emerged well before Christ's birth.

We’ve looked at versions of this argument already.

Second, and more dramatically, he can once again question the truth of this must fundamental founding myth.

Augustine examines Cicero’s own definition of true and flourishing society. (We have to think of Cicero as kind of “founding father” person, similar to George Washington or John Adams)

Cicero, in the mouth of Scipio provided a definition of what it meant for a group of people to be a true society or commonwealth. Augustine reports this in chapter 21.

{:.question}
Question: What is that definition?

<div class="answer">
>p. 61, bttm: “The people” he [Scipio/Cicero] defines as being not every assemblage or mob, but an assemblage associated by a common acknowledgement of law, and by a community of interests.”

>p. 62: “…neither would the people be any longer a people if it were unjust, since it would no longer answer the definition of a people—“an assemblage associated by a common acknowledge of law, and by a community of interests”
</div>

Augustine’s strategy is to question if even the “Great roman republic” every really lived up to this definition: 

> p. 63, top: “…was it not perhaps even then, to use the casual expression of Cicero, rather a coloured painting than the living reality?” (Isn’t that a great phrase?!? What is he getting at with this phrase.)

> p. 63: “Rome never was a republic, because true justice had never has a place in it.”

From Augustine's Christian point of view, how could this republic every people a true city on this definition, a city of permeated by true virtue, if it wasn't under the Lordship of Christ. 


But why then might it have appeared so virtuous, so peaceful, so well run and organized?

In Chapter 18, The historian Sallust seems to directly contradict Augustine and suggests that the early Roman republic really was a place where “equity and virtue prevailed”.

> p. 56, “He was referring to that period immediately after the expulsion of the kings…”

{:.question}
Question: How does Augustine respond to this?

<div class="answer">
It might be true that they “behaved well”. But what was the motivation?

> p. 56, “…the cause of this was not their love of good order, but their fear lest the peace they had with Carthage might be broken”

> p. 57: “You see how, even in that brief period after the expulsion of the kings, fear, he acknowledges, was the cause of the interval of equity and good order”

</div>

I think this is something to which we need to play close attention. 

Augustine's point is that vices can manifest themselves in different way at different periods of time. And some vices can at times restrain others, and create the impression of incredible self-discipline. 

For example, greed or acquisitiveness can, at times, have an amazing socially-harmonious effect. 

<div class="discussion">
Question: How so? 

<span class="respond"/> Examples

A really greedy person might be extremely self-controlled and temperate. 

Thus, it may be the case the societies we hail as shining examples of virtue may in fact be simple moments in history in which more socially harmonious vices reigned supreme. 

This is after all precisely the advice of Adam Smith. Smith’s argument is that self-interest should not be hindered, but rather pursued intelligently, and when pursued intelligently, we will recognize that certain kinds of self-control and social harmonious actions, which have the appearance of virtue, are actually personally advantageous.

Augustine’s seems to be realizing that it is possible to have a well ordered and even externally-flourishing society and for this outwardly-looking virtuous society to still not be the “home” or place of rest our “hearts long for”.
</div>

### Augustine’s: Exposing the Myth

So, its at this point, I like to step and back a little and think about this definition of the city that Cicero and provides and Augustine's response to.

Cicero's definition emerges in a debate with Pilus. 

Pilus says: A city cannot exist without injustice. 

And Scipio responds to the contrary, no in fact there is no city with justice. 

I'd like to consider where Augustine falls within this debate and the ramifications of this position. 

<div class="discussion">
Question: First off, is there any way we can support the position of Pilus. Why might it be impossible to have a functioning city without Injustice. 
</div>

Possible Answer: What about criminal justice and prison system? Is it possible to have city without a criminal justice system? Maybe in a perfect world, but what about in our world, where crimes are committed, etc. 

It would seem not. But punishment for wrong-doing might seem perfectly just. 

But is it possible to have a criminal justice system that never makes a mistake, that never punishes an innocent person? That never causes unnecessary harm or excessive punishment. 

If in fear of punishing an innocent person, we are hesitant in our punishment, we run the risk of not finding justice for a victim, or not deterring future crime and thereby not finding justice for future victims. 

Another possible answer: 

Think of at a more personal, individual level. Martin Luther King, in his letter from Birmingham Jail quotes Aquinas, who states "An unjust law is not a law" in support of civil disobedience. 

This is the Cicero/Scipio View. It is not really a city unless it ruled by justice. And the false city doesn't have any authority us. We should do whatever we need to reject and oppose the false city in order to establish the just city.

This sounds nice, but is it always so easy?

Thoreau, for example, refused to pay taxes in protest of the Spanish American war. He saw something unjust and saw the requirement to pay takes as unjust, and therefore the just thing to do was to refuse to pay taxes. 

But can an action ever be so pure? Is there way, his pursuit of justice, could be at the same time perpetuating new injustices? (What if everyone refused to pay their federal taxes because some of that money was going to something unjust?)

In sum, what Augustine is starting to be attentive to, and will become more pronounced in chapter 19, is the moral ambiguity that pervades life of earth.

In contrast to the pure just city, which he will call the City of God, he says we live now on earth, in the city of men, which because it is a city of mixed people with all kinds of different goals, desires, and allegiances will forever be fraught with moral ambiguity. 

Because of this ambiguity, neither the Roman republic nor Eusebius Christian empire will ever meet Cicero's definition of truly just city.

A fabulous quote 

> p. 59: “But because this man listens, and this man scoffs, and most are enamoured of the blandishments of vice rather than the wholesome severity of virtue, the people of Christ, whatever be their condition…are enjoined to endure this earthly republic”

Augustine (along with Pilus) is putting forward what is sometimes called a "political realist" position (which you might also see in modern theorists like Thomas Hobbes or Reinhold Nieburh), as opposed to a much more classical "political idealism" that you might seen in Aristotle or Cicero. 

For Aristotle, the health of the city and the moral, spiritual, and physical well-being of the individual go hand-in-hand. 

Happiness for the individual is achieved within the city. (Aristotle really doesn't have a concept of the after-life). And that means the happiness of my neighbor inasmuch as it is required or the well-being of the state, contributes to my happiness.

This is our one life to be happy, and we experience within the context of a flourishing city. 

Thus, as an Aristotelian, I have a real interest in making sure the city is perfect or just or fair, because happiness depends on. 

We are starting to see that Augustine's perspective is different. This earthly city is imperfect, morally ambiguous for both the pagan and the christian. There is no sense that the city will ever be perfect and no sense that any citizen will be perfectly happy. Thus we are there to endure it, to travel through it. 

We are "pilgrims", "travelers" all headed in different directions but for a moment finding ourselves on the same path, and we're trying to make the best of it. 

	[again look at quote on p. 59] 

It is no accident that our reading through this course will be filled with discussions of "pilgrims".

And the big open question (to which there will be a variety of competing answers), how do our obligations and citizens and neighbors change, when we think of ourselves as pilgrims within the early city trying to get somewhere else versus citizens at homes eager to make sure we can secure happiness.

If time, let's think about this for a bit. 

Is the self-conception as citizen a positive or negative development or both?

How does your status as a pilgrim in Baltimore effect your relationship the city around you?

Are there ways that it generates conflict (a bad citizen)? 

Are there ways it "frees" you for self sacrifice? etc etc. 

# Key takeaways

* Explaining Roman Decline as example of the "relevance" of history. History used as a way of explaining the present. 
* Roman accusations against Christianity
* Augustine Counter Accusations
  * Admit decline, but deny correlation
  * Deny decline, which raises a deeper political question: what makes a city truly good, truly just? 

# What's Coming Next

* The question raised at the end here will continue in our reading of Book 19. 
  * What is truly just city? 
  * Can it ever it be achieved?
  * How should we organize and arrange our social lives in light of the previous question. If it can be achieved, how should we achieve it? If it can't be achieved, what are we supposed to do?
