For this asynchronous class, I would like to reserve some time for dedicated writing on your final paper. And then I would like you share to some of your progress with the class. 

Based on the discussion questions below I'll be looking for three annotation posts for full participation credit.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion} 
1. Our paper prompt asks you to identify a "problem" or "puzzle" in one of our literary readings or films. Share with the class a "problem" or "puzzle" that you are thinking of pursuing in your paper. (Please try to share with at least 200 words)

Our assignment then asks you to argue for a possible resolution to the above puzzle. Finding, supporting, and communicating this problem can be difficult. 

{:.rquestion} 
2. As you work on your writing and struggle with your problem, share with the class one place you are struggling or still researching for answers? Are trying to make sense of a particular scene, are you looking for strategic pieces of textual evidence or secondary sources? 

3. For your third post please "reply" to a peer's response to the above question about a question or problem they are still struggling with. Can you offer them some help? Can you point them toward some possible primary source text passages?
