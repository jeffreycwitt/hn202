For this asynchronous class, I would like you to reserve some time for dedicated writing on your final paper. And then I would like you share to some of your progress with the class. 

Based on the discussion questions below, I'll be looking for three strong annotation posts for full participation credit.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion} 
Our paper prompt asks you to identify a "problem" or "puzzle" in one of our literary readings or films. Share with the class a "problem" or "puzzle" that you are thinking about pursuing in your paper. (Please try to share with at least 200 words)

Our assignment then asks you to argue for a possible resolution to the above puzzle. Finding a resolution, supporting your claim, and communicating it to other can be difficult. 

{:.rquestion} 
As you work on your writing and struggle with your problem, share with the class one place in your writing where you are struggling or feel stuck? Are you having trouble making sense of a particular scene, are you looking for strategic pieces of textual evidence or secondary sources? Describe the challenge you are facing.

For your third post please "reply" to a peer's response to the above question. Can you offer them some help or suggestions
