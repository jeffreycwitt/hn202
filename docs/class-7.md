# Reflection

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

This reading is so rich and deep, in some ways it hardly needs commentary. Thus, before I offer my survey of key points, I'd like to hear something that you took away from this reading. 

{:.rquestion}
What something significant that you learned from this reading that you didn't know before? Why did it stand out to you as important for understanding the rise of early Islam? (Please share via an annotation and be ready to share during class.)

</div>

# Intro

Today our goal is once again twofold.

First, we need to walk through three distinct periods in the story of early medieval Islam. (Your aim here, as always, should be to internalize these events, so that you could recount them without using notes).

1. The period before Muhammad (5th century to 570)
2. The period of Muhammad's life, especially as a prophet (570-632)
3. The period immediately after his death: The Rightly Guided Caliphs (632-661)

Second, we need to continue looking for parallels and differences to what we've already studied. In this regard, here are some questions to keep in mind. 

* Is there is a concept of a pilgrim status in Islam? How is that status understood?
* How does Muhammad conceive of life on earth?
* How does the conception of religion and the state compare to that of Augustine and Benedict?

# 1. Arab Beduins Before Muhammad

Let's begin with the period leading up to Muhammad's birth. 

##	Mode of subsistence

{:.dquestion}
What was life like in Arabia before the arrival of Muhammad (see pages 26-31)?

{:.answer}
While southern Arabia (modern Yemen) had enough water to support agriculture, cities, and kingship, central and northern Arabia were extremely dry places making agriculture impossible.

{:.dquestion}
What was the dominant mode of existence?

{:.answer}
Nomadic existence.

{:.dquestion}
There were lots of settled people, but the Nomadic Beduins dominated. Why?

{:.answer}
Their superior mobility in the desert landscape gave them an upper hand over settled cities that struggled for subsistence in the arid landscape.

##	Political existence

{:.question}
What was the predominant mode of political existence for such nomadic Arabs?

{:.answer}
Similar to the “barbarians” of northern and eastern Europe, allegiances were made to clans and clans to tribes. Tribes would form loose federations depending on who was the most powerful.

I want to emphasize the point here that, in such a system, political allegiance is to an identifiable "person" (as opposed to an idea, nation, or system that transcends anyone particular person). Specifically, this person is the warrior who emerges as supreme in the clan and then in the tribe. 

Our text had a word for th kind of social solidarity seen among the Beduin: "asabiyyah".

Muhammad's own ancestry illustrates this basic political structure.

He was born into a clan (the "Banu Hashim" sounds like “Ha (ha as in "hat")-shim” clan) which belonged to the "Quraish" (sounds like “Kur-Raish”) tribe, which was a supremely powerful tribe that ruled over other tribes that it had beaten or forced in submission.

This is explained quite well on p. 27:

> "The Quraish had gained control of Makka and its shrines some time during the fifth century under their leader Qusaiy. By the Time of Muhammad's birth their caravans were converging from four cardinal points - north and west from the Syria and the Mediterranean, south and east from Yemen and the Persian Gulf. In the manner of other beduin leaders the Quraish buttressed their power by forming alliances with neighbouring tribes." (Ruthven, p. 27)

This is also explained well on p. 29-30:

> "The power of a tribe was due to its wealth and prowess in battle...A large and wealthy tribe like the Quraish would have numerous 'clients' or weaker tribes (often previously defeated enemies) dependent upon it. Inter-tribal warfare was endemic..." (Ruthven, p. 29-30)

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">  

{:.dquestion}
What are some of the pros of this form of political existence? 

{:.answer}
Allegiance to the "rule of a person" has a kind of instinctual immediacy that can help quickly tie a small group together.

{:.dquestion}
Can you think of some of cons?

{:.answer}
If a community gets too large, this immediacy becomes lost and the allegiance grows thin. If the "ruling person" dies, allegiance is in a sense broken and must be re-established. Succession and continuity is, therefore, difficult and costly. These concerns need to be emphasized as they will be a key to understanding Muhammad's achievement in unifying Arabia.

</div>

##	Religious and Moral Existence

{:.question}
What kind of religion was practiced by these Nomadic Arabs?

{:.answer}
There were various version of paganism. Monotheism seems to be known. Both Christian and Jewish Arabs existed at the time.

{:.rquestion}
What were the predominant values and ethical norms governing the life of the Beduin Arabs at the time? (see p. 29)

{:.answer}
> A key concept in the Beduin value system was "muruwa" (sounds like: mir ee wa) or "manliness". It has been described as meaning 'bravery in battle'....a man would act nobly because of the noble blood that ran through his veins. (Ruthven, p. 29)

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
Does this focus on "muruwa" or "manliness" remind you of any other political/social systems with which you are already familiar?

{:.rquestion}
What are the strengths of this form of social organization?

{:.dquestion}
What are the weaknesses? Why might the primary virtues of "manliness" and the associated honors raise political challenges. 

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

It certainly reminds me of the kind of Homeric virtues that Plato and Aristotle were attempting to domesticate and re-invent by turning the idea of virtue or excellence towards the pursuit of rational excellence rather than physical excellence, and self-domination/mastery rather than other-domination.

When virtue is identified as victory in battle, what does a warrior constantly need? Usually, a battle.

As we we will see, Islamic unity will provide more politically congenial outlets for battle through external conquests. Additionally, religious discipline and the 5 pillars of Islam will provide new and more socially harmonious ways to express virtue. We will see something similar in the run-up to the Crusades when there arose a need to channel warrior activity in more social harmonious directions.

# 2. The life of Muhammad

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
Our reading does a fantastic job of introducing us to Muhammad's early life. What are some of the events or details from this history that stuck you as interesting or particularly important? Tell us why?

</div>


<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

{:.rquestion}
How are Muhammad's revelations received in Mecca? To what extent does he introduce a concept of a "pilgrim life"? And how well is that "pilgrim life" meshing with the existing social system in Mecca?

</div>

Some basic events we know:
* Muhammed was born between 570 and 580 and dies in 632.
* He started having visions around 615

Eventually, in 622, Muhammad relocates to Madina (an event called the "hijra" (sounds like "heedge-ra")).

He is invited to come as a kind arbiter or judge, to help settle disputes between rival tribes and clans. He is, at the same time, worried about persecution from Quraish community in Mecca. The invitation to relocate in Madina therefore came at the perfect time.

{:.question}
How do Muhammad's revelations change after his arrival at Medina? Why?

{:.answer}
Revelations are decidedly more political than oracular.

At Madina, the community has grown larger, and Muhammad is now responsible for the governance and polity of the community (the "Umma").

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

This is an interesting place for some comparisons with Augustine.

As Ruthven writes:

> p. 59: The problem to which the Madinese system was primarily addressed was the maintenance of social cohesion. The new solidarity of the Umma, the Islamic community, replaced the old solidarity of the qawm or tribe.

{:.dquestion}
But what defines a community or Umma? What holds it together? In other words, what is the source of allegiance? (See p. 60-61). Is it to Muhammad? Is it blood ties, a shared vision of justice or happiness, a common interest in a useable peace? Or is it something else? (Remember this is precisely the question Augustine was asking in books 2 and 19 of the *City of God*.) 

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

> "The old tribal system had been at the root of Arabia's problems...What was required was a new field of loyalty which would smooth the transition to a more individualized society...The new solidarity provided by Islam was the Umma, a super-tribal entity whose loyalty was to Allah, the super-tribal deity.

</div>

{:.dquestion}
What is another way that the teaching of Muhammad alters or opposes the heavily Aristocratic that dominates tribal organization? How does this doctrine create a kind of leveling effect across tribes?" (Ruthven, p. 60)

{:.answer}
> "the doctrine of the day of judgement proclaimed in the Quran implied that individuals were primarily responsible for their actions, regardless of birth" (Ruthven, p. 61)

{:.dquestion}
Are there other similarities to Augustine here?

{:.answer}
Like Augustine, Muhammad has put forward a doctrine that asserts a kind of pilgrim status and this status has political consequences.  Earthly conduct will ultimately be judged by a heavenly judgment. 

{:.dquestion}
Why does the author say that this creates a new sense of "individualism"

<div class="answer" markdown="1">
If one believed they could act in a certain way because of their blood or family times, the doctrine of the day of judgment, challenges this. It says, you will be judged as an individual. 

It also changes your self-interested calculus. It creates the possibility that the demands of the community might work at cross purposes with your individual interest. If the community demands something that will be judged on the last day, one has to choose one value system over the other.
</div>
</div>

Despite similarities to Augustine worldview, we also need to be attentive to an important difference.

One of the things we saw in the *City of God* is that Augustine's distinction between the City of God and the City of Man created a distance between the sacramental community (that is never to be fully realized on earth) and the earthly cities that pilgrims must necessarily inhabit while on earth.

This distance prompted Augustine in book 19 of the City of God to tell Christians to be more or less amenable to the laws and customs of whatever polity they find themselves in, as long as these demands don't conflict with the divine commands.

And because Augustine's pilgrims no longer retained hope for the establishment of earthly kingdom of God, it was much easier to accept a certain space and separation between the sacramental community (with distinct spiritual leaders/priests/bishops) of pilgrims and the secular community governed by secular power -- an effect we see today in the West's more or less general acceptance and even celebration of the separation of church and state.

To be sure, there will be other currents of Christian Triumphalism that run through the Middle Ages and there will be moments where this separation is hard to see. But the point is that it is there and it has a pedigree.

This is much less true in the case of Islam.

One passage from our text makes this point really well:

> "Islam is the least 'other-worldly' of the great religious systems, the one which, above all others, seeks to realize its aim in this world. Though the Day of Judgement is perceived as the ultimate moral reckoning by which the worth of individual actions is measured, the good [not just a peaceful] society [compare this to monasticism, which leaves society to focus on individual humility before God] is generally seen as the necessary precondition to salvation. Since there is no church or form of sacerdotal mediation through which men and woman may attain salvation regardless of political circumstance, they must in the last endeavour attempt to realize the ideal of pristine Islam - the Madinese utopia - in order to guarantee their survival in the hereafter. Thus the armed prophet of Madina would remain the perfect exemplar for Muslims of all ages." (Ruthven, p. 77)

In the context of our course and the reading we have already done. This is a really striking quotation.

While oversimplifying, Augustine, Benedictine Monasticism, and Islam offer us a kind of spectrum.

|**retreat** | **endurance** | **realization**|
|Benedict| Augustine | Islam|

To be sure, within Islam, there is a concept of the pilgrim, and sense that we are all journeying to another land and are therefore responsible for working out our salvation in this life.

But the interpretation of how a pilgrim should work out that salvation and the connection between that work and the political community stands in striking contrast to Augustine's vision. Augustine sees the earthly community as a messy compromise, to be "used" by the pilgrim community. But he in no way connects the perfection of that community with the success of individual pilgrimage. In fact, Augustine works hard to separate these two things.

Again, we should emphasize that this is Augustine's vision. Not every Christian community will share this vision. For example, another great point of comparison for us will be between Augustine's vision of pilgrimage and the vision of the Christian crusaders who take up arms to re-capture a very earthly Jerusalem. So, stay tuned.

<!-- 
<div class="discussion" markdown="1">
{:.rquestion}
How does the belief that individual salvation needs to be realized through the "good society" push one toward a kind of political idealism?

{:.rquestion}
How does the political idealist deal with 'bad laws'?

{:.rquestion}
Can a political idealist participate in an imperfect system? How would this effect the choice to be a prosecutor or judge?

# 3. After Muhammad: Conquest and Civil War

In closing, we need to catalogue the main events that constitute the core timeline of Islam after Muhammad's death.

Muhammad dies in 632.

{:.question}
Who was the first successor after Muhammad? (see p. 69)

{:.answer}
Abu Bakr is immediately elected as the successor of Muhammad. 

What is important about this election is Muhammad's cousin Ali gets passed over and this initiates a small rift amongst those who see Ali as the rightful successor.

Why was Ali a likely candidate? He was Muhammad's cousin, an early follower, part of close circle of friends, and husband of Fatima, Muhammad's daughter.

Abu Bakr is forced to use military energy to bring Ali's faction back into the fold. Once accomplished, Bakr uses this military energy to initiate conquests northward. This means conquests in both Persia (modern day Iran) and in the Byzantine (or Eastern Roman Empire).

Interestingly, the "conquests" most likely began as raids for plunder. However, upon arriving, they discovered that many of the to-be-conquered cities were more or less empty.

{:.question}
Why were so many of these provincial outputs empty and unable to offer resistance?

{:.answer}
As we have seen, Byzantium and Persia had been at war for a long time, and by the 630s they had nearly exhausted each other. Bakr's raids were, therefore, well timed and quickly turned from raids into conquests. 

Abu Bakr dies in 634.

{:.question}
Who succeeds Bakr? (see p. 69)

{:.answer}
Bakr is followed by 'Umar or Omar (r. from 634 and 644).

Under 'Umar, conquests begin on a dramatic scale. All of Persia is conquered, Byzantium loses Syria, Palestine, and Egypt. (see p. 69).

Umar dies in 644 after an extremely successful 10 year reign.

{:.question}
Who succeeds Umar? (see p. 72)

{:.answer} 
Umar is succeeded by Uthman.

Uthman's ascendancy was not well liked by many for a few different reasons.

* Uthman is a member of the Umayyad clan. This clan was still part of the Quraish tribe, but it was a high status Meccan clan that was initially an outspoken critic of the upstart Muhammad.
* He was also seen as personally decadent, profligate, and corrupt.

Uthman is murdered in 656 and this is the beginning of a civil war.

Followers of Ali, Muhammad's cousin, who had been passed over in all preceding successions, declared him leader or Caliph.

But Ali's ascendancy in the wake of the murder of Uthman is suspect and not liked by the Umayyad clan.
Mu'awiya (sounds like “Moo-ow-ee-ya”) revolts and leads a rival group.

Ali dies in 661, bringing the feud to an abrupt end, leaving Mu'awiya, and the Umayyad dynasty, firmly in control as the leader of what is now Islam's Umayyad Dynasty, which lasts until 750.

The reason this history is important is that this medieval dispute shapes the beginning of the most fundamental division in Islam: the division between Shia and Sunnis.

Among other differences, Shia believe that Ali was the rightful and appointed successor of Muhammad. While Sunnis do not believe a successor was appointed and that Caliphs were to be appointed through consensus. Accordingly, Bakr was the legitimate first Caliph.

Sunnis by far are the larger sect today, while Shia are concentrated primarily in Iran (persia), parts of Iraq, and Yemen.

More generally, Shia, like Ali himself, have been throughout the history of Islam a minority that attracts outsiders, for example, non-arab converts, such as the Persians.

We will look closer at this dynamic next time.

# Key takeaways

* Muhammad's revelations introduced a new vision of individual and political life that was threatening to the status quo in Mecca. 
* While in Medina, Muhammad had to work hard to develop a new basis for social solidarity.
* The "Pilgrim" life that Muhammad envisioned shares some similarities with the vision of Augustine but also some key differences.

# What's Next

* Next we will trace the main events of the Umayyad dynasty and the rise of the next dynasty, the Abbasid Dynasty.
* We will also look at the new political challenges faced by the Abbasids, as well as the political and legal changes that were made to address these challenges.
* In particular, we will look at the development of the "hadith" tradition and the intellectual foundations of Sharia Law.
